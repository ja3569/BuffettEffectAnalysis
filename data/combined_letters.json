The components of that figure are $24 billion of operating earnings, $3.7 billion of realized capitalgains and a $53.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealizedcapital gains that exist in the stocks we hold. Each of those components of earnings is stated on an after-tax basis.That $53.7 billion gain requires comment. It resulted from a new GAAP rule, imposed in 2018, that requiresa company holding equity securities to include in earnings the net change in the unrealizedgains and losses of those securities. As we stated in last year\u2019s letter, neither Charlie Munger, my partner in managing Berkshire, nor I agreewith that rule.The adoption of the rule by the accounting profession, in fact, was a monumental shift in its own thinking.Before 2018, GAAP insisted \u2013 with an exception for companies whose business was to trade securities \u2013 thatunrealizedgainswithin a portfolio of stocks wereneverto be included in earnings and unrealizedlosseswere to be includedonlyif they were deemed \u201cother than temporary.\u201d Now, Berkshire must enshrine in each quarter\u2019s bottomline \u2013 a key item of news for many investors, analysts and commentators \u2013 every up and down movement of the stocksit owns, however capricious those fluctuations may be.Berkshire\u2019s 2018 and 2019 years glaringly illustrate the argument we have with the new rule. In 2018, a downyear for the stock market, our net unrealized gains decreasedby $20.6 billion, and we therefore reported GAAP earnings of only $4 billion. In 2019,risingstock prices increased net unrealized gains by the aforementioned $53.7billion, pushing GAAP earnings to the $81.4 billion reported at the beginning of this letter. Those market gyrationsled to a crazy 1,900% increase in GAAP earnings!Meanwhile, in what we might call the real world, as opposed to accounting-land, Berkshire\u2019s equity holdingsaveraged about $200 billion during the two years, and the intrinsic valueof the stocks we own grew steadily and substantially throughout the period.Charlie and I urge you to focus on operating earnings \u2013 which were little changed in 2019 \u2013 and to ignoreboth quarterly and annual gains or losses from investments, whether these are realized or unrealized.Our advising thatin no waydiminishes the importance of these investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlieand I expect our equity holdings \u2013 as a group \u2013 to deliver majorgains, albeit in an unpredictable and highly irregular manner. To see why we are optimistic, move on to the next discussion.The Power of Retained EarningsIn 1924, Edgar Lawrence Smith, an obscure economist and financial advisor, wrote Common Stocks as Long Term Investments, a slim book that changed the investment world. Indeed, writing the book changed Smith himself,forcing him to reassess his own investment beliefs.Going in, he planned to argue that stocks would perform better than bonds during inflationary periods andthat bonds would deliver superior returns during deflationary times. That seemed sensible enough. But Smith was infor a shock.3His book began, therefore, with a confession: \u201cThese studies are the record of a failure \u2013 the failure of factsto sustain a preconceived theory.\u201d Luckily for investors, that failure led Smith to think more deeply about how stocksshould be evaluated.For the crux of Smith\u2019s insight, I will quote an early reviewer of his book, none other than John MaynardKeynes: \u201cI have kept until last what is perhaps Mr. Smith\u2019s most important, and is certainly his most novel, point.Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits.In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back into the business. Thus there is an element of compound interest(Keynes\u2019 italics) operating in favour of a sound industrial investment. Over a periodof years, the real value of the property of a sound industrial is increasing at compound interest, quite apart from thedividends paid out to the shareholders.\u201dAnd with that sprinkling of holy water, Smith was no longer obscure.It\u2019s difficult to understand why retained earnings were unappreciated by investors before Smith\u2019s book waspublished. After all, it was no secret that mind-boggling wealth had earlier been amassed by such titans as Carnegie,Rockefeller and Ford, all of whom had retained a huge portion of their business earnings to fund growth and produceever-greater profits. Throughout America, also, there had long been small-time capitalists who became rich followingthe same playbook.Nevertheless, when business ownership was sliced into small pieces \u2013 \u201cstocks\u201d \u2013 buyers in the pre-Smithyears usually thought of their shares as a short-term gamble on market movements. Even at their best, stocks wereconsidered speculations.Gentlemenpreferred bonds.Though investors were slow to wise up, the math of retaining and reinvesting earnings is now wellunderstood. Today, school children learn what Keynes termed \u201cnovel\u201d: combining savings with compound interestworks wonders. ************At Berkshire, Charlie and I have long focused on using retained earnings advantageously. Sometimes thisjob has been easy \u2013 at other times, more than difficult, particularly when we began working with huge and ever-growing sums of money.In our deployment of the funds we retain, we first seek to invest in the many and diverse businesses wealready own. During the past decade, Berkshire\u2019s depreciation charges have aggregated $65 billion whereas thecompany\u2019sinternalinvestments in property, plant and equipment have totaled $121 billion. Reinvestment inproductive operational assets will forever remain our top priority.In addition, we constantly seek to buy new businesses that meet three criteria. First, they must earn goodreturns on the net tangible capital required in their operation. Second, they must be run by able and honest managers.Finally, they must be available at a sensible price.When we spot such businesses, our preference would be to buy 100% of them. But the opportunities to makemajor acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare. Far more often, a fickle stock market serves upopportunities for us to buy large,but non-controlling, positions in publicly-traded companies that meet our standards.Whichever way we go \u2013 controlled companies or only a major stake by way of the stock market \u2013 Berkshire\u2019sfinancial results from the commitment will in large part be determined by the future earnings of the business we havepurchased. Nonetheless, there is between the two investment approaches a hugely important accounting difference,essential for you to understand.\n4In our controlled companies, (defined as those in which Berkshire owns more than 50% of the shares), theearnings of each business flow directly into the operating earnings that we report to you. What you see is what youget.In the non-controlled companies, in which we own marketable stocks, onlythe dividends that Berkshire receives are recorded in the operating earnings we report. The retained earnings? They\u2019re working hard and creatingmuch added value, butnotin a way that deposits those gains directly into Berkshire\u2019s reported earnings.At almost all major companies other than Berkshire, investors would notfind what we\u2019ll call this \u201cnon- recognition of earnings\u201d important. For us, however, it is a standout omission, of a magnitude that we lay out for youbelow.Here, we list our 10 largest stock-market holdings of businesses. The list distinguishes between their earningsthat are reported to you under GAAP accounting \u2013 these are the dividends Berkshire receives from those 10 investees\u2013 and our share, so to speak, of the earnings the investees retain and put to work. Normally, those companies useretained earnings to expand their business and increase its efficiency. Or sometimes they use those funds to repurchasesignificant portions of their own stock, an act that enlarges Berkshire\u2019s share of the company\u2019s future earnings.YearendOwnership\nBerkshire\u2019s Share (in millions)\nCompany Dividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\nAmerican Express 18.7% $ 261 $ 998Apple 5.7% 773 2,519Bank of America 10.7% 682 2,167Bank of New York Mellon 9.0% 101 288Coca-Cola 9.3% 640 194Delta Airlines 11.0% 114 416J.P.

Sometimes, alas, retentions produce nothing. But bothlogic and our past experience indicate that from the groupwe will realize capital gains at least equal to \u2013 and probably better than \u2013 the earnings of ours that they retained. (When we sell shares and realize gains, we will pay income tax onthe gain at whatever rate then prevails. Currently, the federal rate is 21%.)It is certain that Berkshire\u2019s rewards from these 10 companies, as well as those from our many other equityholdings, will manifest themselves in a highly irregular manner. Periodically, there will be losses, sometimescompany-specific, sometimes linked to stock-market swoons. At other times \u2013 last year was one of those \u2013 our gainwill be outsized. Overall, the retained earnings of our investees are certain to be of majorimportance in the growth of Berkshire\u2019s value.Mr. Smith got it right.\n5Non-Insurance OperationsTom Murphy, a valued director of Berkshire and an all-time great among business managers, long ago gaveme some important advice about acquisitions: \u201cTo achieve a reputation as a good manager, just be sure you buy goodbusinesses.\u201dOver the years Berkshire has acquired many dozens of companies, all of which I initially regarded as \u201cgoodbusinesses.\u201d Some, however, proved disappointing; more than a few were outright disasters. A reasonable number, onthe other hand, have exceeded my hopes.In reviewing my uneven record, I\u2019ve concluded that acquisitions are similar to marriage: They start, of course,with a joyful wedding \u2013 but then reality tends to diverge from pre-nuptial expectations. Sometimes, wonderfully, thenew union delivers bliss beyond either party\u2019s hopes. In other cases, disillusionment is swift. Applying those imagesto corporate acquisitions, I\u2019d have to say it is usually the buyer who encounters unpleasant surprises. It\u2019s easy to getdreamy-eyed during corporate courtships.Pursuing that analogy, I would say that our marital record remains largely acceptable, with all parties happywith the decisions they made long ago. Some of our tie-ups have been positively idyllic. A meaningful number,however, have caused me all too quickly to wonder what I was thinking when I proposed.Fortunately, the fallout from many of my errors has been reduced by a characteristic shared by mostbusinesses that disappoint: As the years pass, the \u201cpoor\u201d business tends to stagnate, thereupon entering a state in whichits operations require an ever-smallerpercentageof Berkshire\u2019s capital. Meanwhile, our \u201cgood\u201d businesses often tend to grow and find opportunities for investing additional capital at attractive rates. Because of these contrastingtrajectories, the assets employed at Berkshire\u2019s winners gradually become an expanding portion of our total capital.As an extreme example of those financial movements, witness Berkshire\u2019s original textile business. Whenwe acquired control of the company in early 1965, this beleaguered operation required nearly allof Berkshire\u2019s capital. For some time, therefore, Berkshire\u2019s non-earning textile assets were a huge drag on our overall returns. Eventually,though, we acquired a spread of \u201cgood\u201d businesses, a shift that by the early 1980s caused the dwindling textileoperation to employ only a tiny portion of our capital.Today, we have most of your money deployed in controlled businesses that achieve good-to-excellent returnson the net tangible assets each requires for its operations. Our insurance business has been the superstar. That operationhas special characteristics that give it a unique metric for calibrating success, one unfamiliar to many investors. Wewill save that discussion for the next section.In the paragraphs that follow, we group our wide array of non-insurance businesses by size of earnings, after interest, depreciation, taxes, non-cash compensation, restructuring charges \u2013 all of those pesky, but very real, coststhat CEOs and Wall Street sometimes urge investors to ignore. Additional information about these operations can befound on pages K-6 \u2013 K-21 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-52.Our BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) \u2013 the two lead dogs of Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance group \u2013 earned a combined $8.3 billion in 2019 (including only our 91% share of BHE), an increase of 6%from 2018.Our next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), ClaytonHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate earnings in 2019 of$4.8 billion, little changed from what these companies earned in 2018.The next five, similarly ranked and listed (Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Johns Manville, NetJets, Shawand TTI) earned $1.9 billion last year, up from the $1.7 billion earned by this tier in 2018.\n6The remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns \u2013 and there are many \u2013 had aggregate earningsof $2.7 billion in 2019, down from $2.8 billion in 2018.Our total net income in 2019 from the non-insurance businesses we control amounted to $17.7 billion, anincrease of 3% from the $17.2 billion this group earned in 2018. Acquisitions and dispositions had almost no net effecton these results. ************I must add one final item that underscores the wide scope of Berkshire\u2019s operations. Since 2011, we haveowned Lubrizol, an Ohio-based company that produces and markets oil additives throughout the world. On September26, 2019, a fire originating at a small next-door operation spread to a large French plant owned by Lubrizol.The result was significant property damage and a major disruption in Lubrizol\u2019s business. Even so, both thecompany\u2019s property loss and business-interruption loss will be mitigated by substantial insurance recoveries thatLubrizol will receive.But, as the late Paul Harvey was given to saying in his famed radio broadcasts, \u201cHere\u2019s the rest of the story.\u201dOne of the largest insurers of Lubrizol was a company owned b y...u h ,Berkshire. In Matthew 6:3, the Bible instructs us to \u201cLet not the left hand know what the right hand doeth.\u201d Yourchairman has clearly behaved as ordered.Property/Casualty InsuranceOur property/casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurance business has been the engine propelling Berkshire\u2019s growth since1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million.Today, National Indemnity is the largest P/C company in the world as measured by net worth. Insurance is a businessof promises, and Berkshire\u2019s ability to honor its commitments is unmatched.One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry\u2019s business model: P/C insurers receivepremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severeworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 thatwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And howit has grown, as the following table shows:Year\nFloat (in millions)\n1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322018 122,7322019 129,423We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be verygradual \u2013 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can neverbe subject to immediate or near- term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a keycomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will neverbe compromised.7If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers anunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy theuse of free money \u2013 and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it.For the P/C industry as a whole, the financial value of float is now far less than it was for many years. That\u2019sbecause the standard investment strategy for almost all P/C companies is heavily \u2013 and properly\u2013 skewed toward high-grade bonds. Changes in interest rates therefore matter enormously to these companies, and during the last decadethe bond market has offered pathetically low rates.Consequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced \u2013 by maturities or issuer-call provisions \u2013to recycle their \u201cold\u201d investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields. Where once these insurerscould safely earn 5 cents or 6 cents on each dollar of float, they now take in only 2 cents or 3 cents (or even less iftheir operations are concentrated in countries mired in the never-never land of negative rates).Some insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid\u201calternative\u201d investments promising higher yields. But those are dangerous games and activities that most institutionsare ill-equipped to play.Berkshire\u2019s situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general. Most important, our unrivaledmountain of capital, abundance of cash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far moreinvestment flexibility than is generally available to other companies in the industry. The many choices open to us arealways advantageous \u2013 and sometimes have presented us with major opportunities.Our P/C companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at anunderwriting profit for 16 of the last 17 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was a whopping $3.2billion. For the entire 17-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27.5 billion, of which $400 million was recorded in 2019.That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, whoknow that the rewards of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.As I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from asure thing: We will most certainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years. Danger always lurks.Mistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years \u2013 even decades \u2013 to surface andripen. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael willoccur \u2013 perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. \u201cThe Big One\u201d may come from a traditional source, such as wind orearthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anythinginsurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of the losses and theywill be big \u2013verybig. Unlike many other insurers, however, handling the loss will not come close to straining ourresources, and we will be eager toaddto our business the next day.** **********Close your eyes for a moment and try to envision a locale that might spawn a dynamic P/C insurer. NewYork? London? Silicon Valley?How about Wilkes-Barre?\n8Late in 2012, Ajit Jain, the invaluable manager of our insurance operations, called to tell me that he wasbuying a tiny company \u2013 GUARD Insurance Group \u2013 in that small Pennsylvania city for $221 million (roughly its networth at the time). He added that Sy Foguel, GUARD\u2019s CEO, was going to be a star at Berkshire. Both GUARD andSy were new names to me.Bingo and bingo: In 2019, GUARD had premium volume of $1.9 billion, up 379% since 2012, and alsodelivered a satisfactory underwriting profit. Since joining Berkshire, Sy has led the company into both new productsand new regions of the country and has increased GUARD\u2019s float by 265%.In 1967, Omaha seemed an unlikely launching pad for a P/C giant. Wilkes-Barre may well deliver a similarsurprise.Berkshire Hathaway EnergyBerkshire Hathaway Energy is now celebrating its 20\nthyear under our ownership. That anniversary suggests that we should be catching up with the company\u2019s accomplishments.We\u2019ll start with the topic of electricity rates. When Berkshire entered the utility business in 2000, purchasing76% of BHE, the company\u2019s residential customers in Iowa paid an average of 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).Prices for residential customers have since risen less than 1% a year, and we have promised that there will be no baserate price increases through 2028. In contrast, here\u2019s what is happening at the other large investor-owned Iowa utility:Last year, the rates it charged its residential customers were 61% higher than BHE\u2019s. Recently, that utility received arate increase that will widen the gap to 70%.The extraordinary differential between our rates and theirs is largely the result of our huge accomplishmentsin converting wind into electricity. In 2021, we expect BHE\u2019s operation to generate about 25.2 million megawatt-hoursof electricity (MWh) in Iowa from wind turbines that it both owns and operates. That output will totally cover theannual needs of its Iowa customers, which run to about 24.6 million MWh. In other words, our utility will have attainedwind self-sufficiency in the state of Iowa.In still another contrast, that other Iowa utility generates less than 10% of its power from wind. Furthermore,we know of no other investor-owned utility, wherever located, that by 2021 will have achieved a position of windself-sufficiency. In 2000, BHE was serving an agricultural-based economy; today, three of its five largest customersare high-tech giants. I believe their decisions to site plants in Iowa were in part based upon BHE\u2019s ability to deliverrenewable, low-cost energy.Of course, wind is intermittent, and our blades in Iowa turn only part of the time. In certain periods, whenthe air is still, we look to our non-wind generating capacity to secure the electricity we need. At opposite times, wesell the excess power that wind provides us to other utilities, serving them through what\u2019s called \u201cthe grid.\u201d The powerwe sell them supplants their need for a carbon resource \u2013 coal, say, or natural gas.Berkshire Hathaway now owns 91% of BHE in partnership with Walter Scott, Jr. and Greg Abel. BHE hasnever paid Berkshire Hathaway a dividend since our purchase and has, as the years have passed, retained $28 billionof earnings. That pattern is an outlier in the world of utilities, whose companies customarily pay big dividends \u2013sometimes reaching, or even exceeding, 80% of earnings. Our view: The more we can invest, the more we like it.Today, BHE has the operating talent and experience to manage truly huge utility projects \u2013 requiringinvestments of $100 billion or more \u2013 that could support infrastructure benefitting our country, our communities andour shareholders. We stand ready, willing and able to take on such opportunities.\n9InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We excludeour Kraft Heinz holding \u2013 325,442,152 shares \u2013 because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the \u201cequity\u201d method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries the Kraft Heinz holding ata GAAP figure of $13.8 billion, an amount that represents Berkshire\u2019s share of the audited net worth of Kraft Heinzat December 31, 2019. Please note, though, that the market value of our shares on that date was only $10.5 billion. 12/31/19Shares*\nCompanyPercentage ofCompanyOwned\nCost** Market\n(in millions) 151,610,700 American Express Company..................18.7 $ 1,287 $ 18,874 250,866,566 Apple Inc................................. 5 . 7 35,287 73,667 947,760,000 Bank of America Corp.......................10.7 12,560 33,380 81,488,751 The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ........... 9 . 03,696 4,101 5,426,609 Charter Communications, Inc................. 2 . 6 9 4 4 2,632 400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company.................... 9 . 31,299 22,140 70,910,456 Delta Air Lines, Inc.........................11.0 3,125 4,147 12,435,814 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc................ 3 . 5 8 9 0 2,859 60,059,932 JPMorgan Chase & Co....................... 1 . 9 6,556 8,372 24,669,778 Moody\u2019s Corporation.......................13.1 248 5,857 46,692,713 Southwest Airlines Co....................... 9 . 0 1,940 2,520 21,938,642 United Continental Holdings Inc. .............. 8 . 71,195 1,933 149,497,786 U.S. Bancorp.............................. 9 . 7 5,709 8,864 10,239,160 Visa Inc.................................. 0 . 6 3 4 9 1,924 345,688,918 Wells Fargo & Company..................... 8 . 4 7,040 18,598 Others***................................ 28,215 38,159\nTotal Equity Investments Carried at Market......$110,340 $248,027\n* Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.** This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis.*** Includes $10 billion investment in Occidental Petroleum Corporation consisting of preferred stock andwarrants to buy common stock.Charlie and I donotview the $248 billion detailed above as a collection of stock market wagers \u2013 dalliancesto be terminated because of downgrades by \u201cthe Street,\u201d an earnings \u201cmiss,\u201d expected Federal Reserve actions,possible political developments, forecasts by economists or whatever else might be the subject du jour. What we see in our holdings, rather, is an assembly of companies that we partly own and that, on a weightedbasis, are earning more than20%on the net tangible equity capital required to run their businesses. These companies,also, earn their profits without employing excessive levels of debt.Returns of that order by large, established and understandable businesses are remarkable under anycircumstances. They are truly mind-blowing when compared to the returns that many investors have accepted onbonds over the last decade \u2013 2\n1\u20442% or even less on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, for example.\n10Forecasting interest rates has never been our game, and Charlie and I have noidea what rates will average over the next year, or ten or thirty years. Our perhaps jaundiced view is that the pundits who opine on these subjectsreveal, by that very behavior, far more about themselves than they reveal about the future.What wecansay is thatifsomething close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if corporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy, it is almost certain that equities will over time perform far better than long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments.That rosy prediction comes with a warning:Anythingcan happen to stock prices tomorrow. Occasionally, there will be major drops in the market, perhaps of 50% magnitude or even greater. But the combination of TheAmerican Tailwind, about which I wrote last year, and the compounding wonders described by Mr. Smith, will makeequities the much better long-term choice for the individual who does not use borrowed money and who can controlhis or her emotions. Others? Beware!The Road AheadThree decades ago, my Midwestern friend, Joe Rosenfield, then in his 80s, received an irritating letter fromhis local newspaper. In blunt words, the paper asked for biographical data it planned to use in Joe\u2019s obituary. Joedidn\u2019t respond. So? A month later, he got a second letter from the paper, this one labeled \u201cURGENT.\u201dCharlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone. That\u2019s not exactly great news for us. But Berkshireshareholders need not worry: Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.The two of us base our optimism upon five factors. First, Berkshire\u2019s assets are deployed in an extraordinaryvariety of wholly or partly-owned businesses that, averaged out, earn attractive returns on the capital they use. Second,Berkshire\u2019s positioning of its \u201ccontrolled\u201d businesses within a single entity endows it with some important andenduring economic advantages. Third, Berkshire\u2019s financial affairs will unfailingly be managed in a manner allowingthe company to withstand external shocks of an extreme nature. Fourth, we possess skilled and devotedtop managers for whom running Berkshire is far more than simply having a high-paying and/or prestigious job. Finally, Berkshire\u2019sdirectors \u2013 your guardians \u2013 are constantly focused on both the welfare of owners and the nurturing of a culture thatis rare among giant corporations. (The value of this culture is explored in Margin of Trust, a new book by Larry Cunningham and Stephanie Cuba that will be available at our annual meeting.)Charlie and I have very pragmatic reasons for wanting to assure Berkshire\u2019s prosperity in the years followingour exit: The Mungers have Berkshire holdings that dwarf any of the family\u2019s other investments, and I have a full 99%of my net worth lodged in Berkshire stock. I have never sold any shares and have no plans to do so. My only disposalof Berkshire shares, aside from charitable donations and minor personal gifts, took place in 1980, when I, along withother Berkshire stockholders who elected to participate, exchanged some of our Berkshire shares for the shares of anIllinois bank that Berkshire had purchased in 1969 and that, in 1980, needed to be offloaded because of changes in thebank holding company law.Today, my will specifically directs its executors \u2013 as well as the trustees who will succeed them inadministering my estate after the will is closed \u2013 not to sell anyBerkshire shares. My will also absolves both the executors and the trustees from liability for maintaining what obviously will be an extreme concentration of assets.The will goes on to instruct the executors \u2013 and, in time, the trustees \u2013 to each year convert a portion of myA shares into B shares and then distribute the Bs to various foundations. Those foundations will be required to deploytheir grants promptly. In all, I estimate that it will take 12 to 15 years for the entirety of the Berkshire shares I hold atmy death to move into the market.Absent my will\u2019s directive that all my Berkshire shares should be held until their scheduled distribution dates,the \u201csafe\u201d course for both my executors and trustees would be to sell the Berkshire shares under their temporarycontrol and reinvest the proceeds in U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities matching the scheduled dates fordistributions. That strategy would leave the fiduciaries immune from both public criticism and the possibility ofpersonal liability for failure to act in accordance with the \u201cprudent man\u201d standard.11I myself feel comfortable that Berkshire shares will provide a safe and rewarding investment during thedisposal period. There is always a chance \u2013 unlikely, but not negligible \u2013 that events will prove me wrong. I believe,however, that there is a high probability that my directive will deliver substantially greater resources to society thanwould result from a conventional course of action.Key to my \u201cBerkshire-only\u201d instructions is my faith in the future judgment and fidelity of Berkshire directors.They will regularly be tested by Wall Streeters bearing fees. At many companies, these super-salesmen might win. Ido not, however, expect that to happen at Berkshire.Boards of DirectorsIn recent years, both the composition of corporate boards and their purpose have become hot topics. Once,debate about the responsibilities of boards was largely limited to lawyers; today, institutional investors and politicianshave weighed in as well.My credentials for discussing corporate governance include the fact that, over the last 62 years, I have servedas a director of 21 publicly-owned companies (listed below). In all but two of them, I have represented a substantialholding of stock. In a few cases, I have tried to implement important change.During the first 30 or so years of my services, it was rare to find a woman in the room unless she representeda family controlling the enterprise. This year, it should be noted, marks the 100\nthanniversary of the 19thAmendment, which guaranteed American women the right to have their voices heard in a voting booth. Their attaining similar statusin a board room remains a work in progress.Over the years, many new rules and guidelines pertaining to board composition and duties have come intobeing. The bedrock challenge for directors, nevertheless, remains constant: Find and retain a talented CEO \u2013possessing integrity, for sure \u2013 who will bedevotedto the company for his/her business lifetime. Often, that task is hard. When directors get it right, though, they need to do little else. But when they mess it up ,...... Audit committees now work much harder than they once did and almost always view the job with appropriateseriousness. Nevertheless, these committees remain no match for managers who wish to game numbers, an offensethat has been encouraged by the scourge of earnings \u201cguidance\u201d and the desire of CEOs to \u201chit the number.\u201d My directexperience (limited, thankfully) with CEOs who have played with a company\u2019s numbers indicates that they were moreoften prompted by ego than by a desire for financial gain.Compensation committees now rely much more heavily on consultants than they used to. Consequently,compensation arrangements have become more complicated \u2013 what committee member wants to explain paying largefees year after year for asimpleplan? \u2013 and the reading of proxy material has become a mind-numbing experience.Oneveryimportant improvement in corporate governance has been mandated: a regularly-scheduled\u201cexecutive session\u201d of directors at which the CEO is barred. Prior to that change, truly frank discussions of a CEO\u2019sskills, acquisition decisions and compensation were rare.Acquisition proposals remain a particularly vexing problem for board members. The legal orchestration formaking deals has been refined and expanded (a word aptly describing attendant costs as well). But I have yet to see aCEO who craves an acquisition bring in an informed and articulate critic to argue against it. And yes, include meamong the guilty.\nBerkshire, Blue Chip Stamps, Cap Cities-ABC, Coca-Cola, Data Documents, Dempster, General Growth, Gillette,Kraft Heinz, Maracaibo Oil, Munsingwear, Omaha National Bank, Pinkerton\u2019s, Portland Gas Light, Salomon,Sanborn Map, Tribune Oil, U.S. Air, Vornado, Washington Post, Wesco Financial 12Overall, the deck is stacked in favor of the deal that\u2019s coveted by the CEO and his/her obliging staff. It wouldbe an interesting exercise for a company to hire two \u201cexpert\u201d acquisition advisors, one pro and one con, to deliver hisor her views on a proposed deal to the board \u2013 with the winning advisor to receive, say, ten times a token sum paid tothe loser. Don\u2019t hold your breath awaiting this reform: The current system, whatever its shortcomings for shareholders,works magnificently for CEOs and the many advisors and other professionals who feast on deals. A venerable cautionwill forever be true when advice from Wall Street is contemplated: Don\u2019t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.Over the years, board \u201cindependence\u201d has become a new area of emphasis. One key point relating to thistopic, though, is almost invariably overlooked: Director compensation has now soared to a level that inevitably makespay a subconscious factor affecting the behavior of many non-wealthy members. Think, for a moment, of the directorearning $250,000-300,000 for board meetings consuming a pleasant couple of days six or so times a year. Frequently,the possession of one such directorship bestows on its holder three to four times the annualmedian income of U.S. households. (I missed much of this gravy train: As a director of Portland Gas Light in the early 1960s, I received $100annuallyfor my service. To earn this princely sum, I commuted to Maine four times a year.)And job security now? It\u2019s fabulous. Board members may get politely ignored, but they seldom get fired.Instead, generous age limits \u2013 usually 70 or higher \u2013 act as the standard method for the genteel ejection of directors.Is it any wonder that a non-wealthy director (\u201cNWD\u201d) now hopes \u2013 or even yearns \u2013 to be asked to join asecond board, thereby vaulting into the $500,000-600,000 class? To achieve this goal, the NWD will need help. TheCEO of a company searching for board members will almost certainly check with the NWD\u2019s current CEO as towhether NWD is a \u201cgood\u201d director. \u201cGood,\u201d of course, is a code word. If the NWD has seriously challenged his/herpresent CEO\u2019s compensation or acquisition dreams, his or her candidacy will silently die. When seeking directors,CEOs don\u2019t look for pit bulls. It\u2019s the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.Despite the illogic of it all, the director for whom fees are important \u2013 indeed, craved \u2013 is almost universallyclassified as \u201cindependent\u201d while many directors possessing fortunes very substantially linked to the welfare of thecorporation are deemed lacking in independence. Not long ago, I looked at the proxy material of a large Americancompany and found thateightdirectors had never purchased a share of the company\u2019s stock using their own money. (They, of course, had receivedgrantsof stock as a supplement to their generous cash compensation.) This particularcompany had long been a laggard, but the directors were doing wonderfully.Paid-with-my-own-money ownership, of course, does notcreate wisdom or ensure business smarts. Nevertheless, I feel better when directors of our portfolio companies have had the experience of purchasing shareswith their savings, rather than simply having been the recipients of grants. ************Here, a pause is due: I\u2019d like you to know that almost all of the directors I have met over the years have beendecent, likable and intelligent. They dressed well, made good neighbors and were fine citizens. I\u2019ve enjoyed theircompany. Among the group are some men and women that I would not have met except for our mutual board serviceand who have become close friends.Nevertheless, many of these good souls are people whom I would never have chosen to handle money orbusiness matters. It simply was not their game.They, in turn, would never have asked me for help in removing a tooth, decorating their home or improvingtheir golf swing. Moreover, if I were ever scheduled to appear on Dancing With the Stars, I would immediately seek refuge in the Witness Protection Program. We are all duds at one thing or another. For most of us, the list is long. Theimportant point to recognize is that if you are Bobby Fischer, you must play onlychess for money. At Berkshire, we will continue to look for business-savvy directors who are owner-oriented and arrive witha strong specific interest in our company. Thought and principles, not robot-like \u201cprocess,\u201d will guide their actions.In representingyourinterests, they will, of course, seek managers whose goals include delighting their customers,cherishing their associates and acting as good citizens of both their communities and our country.13Those objectives are not new. They were the goals of able CEOs sixty years ago and remain so. Who wouldhave it otherwise?Short SubjectsIn past reports, we\u2019ve discussed both the sense and nonsense of stock repurchases. Our thinking, boiled down:Berkshire will buy back its stock only if a) Charlie and I believe that it is selling for less than it is worth and b) thecompany, upon completing the repurchase, is left with ample cash.Calculations of intrinsic value are far from precise. Consequently, neither of us feels any urgency to buy anestimated$1 of value for a very real 95 cents. In 2019, the Berkshire price/value equation was modestlyfavorable at times, and we spent $5 billion in repurchasing about 1% of the company.Over time, we want Berkshire\u2019s share count to go down. If the price-to-value discount (as we estimate it) widens, we will likely become more aggressive in purchasing shares. We will not, however, prop the stock at anylevel.Shareholders having at least $20 million in value of A or B shares and an inclination to sell shares to Berkshiremay wish to have their broker contact Berkshire\u2019s Mark Millard at 402-346-1400. We request that you phone Markbetween 8:00-8:30 a.m. or 3:00-3:30 p.m. Central Time, calling only if you are ready to sell. ************In 2019, Berkshire sent $3.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury to pay its current income tax. The U.S. governmentcollected $243 billion from corporate income tax payments during the same period. From these statistics, you can takepride that your company delivered 1\n1\u20442% of the federal income taxes paid byallof corporate America. Fifty-five years ago, when Berkshire entered its current incarnation, the company paid nothingin federal income tax. (For good reason, too: Over the previous decade, the struggling business had recorded a net loss.) Sincethen, as Berkshire retained nearly all of its earnings, the beneficiaries of that policy became not only the company\u2019sshareholders but also the federal government. In most future years, we both hope and expect to send farlarger sums to the Treasury. ************On pages A-2 \u2013 A-3, you will find details about our annual meeting, which will be held on May 2, 2020.Yahoo, as usual, will be streaming the event worldwide. There will be one important change, however, in our format:I\u2019ve had suggestions from shareholders, media and board members that Ajit Jain and Greg Abel \u2013 our two keyoperating managers \u2013 be given more exposure at the meeting. That change makes great sense. They are outstandingindividuals, both as managers and as human beings, and you should hear more from them.Shareholders who this year send a question to be asked by our three long-serving journalists may specify thatit be posed to Ajit or Greg. They, like Charlie and me, will not have even a hint of what the questions will be.The journalists will alternate questions with those from the audience, who also can direct questions to any ofthe four of us. So polish up your zingers. ************On May 2\nnd, come to Omaha. Meet your fellow capitalists. Buy some Berkshire products. Have fun. Charlieand I \u2013 along with the entire Berkshire gang \u2013 are looking forward to seeing you.February 22, 2020 Warren E.

Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at mar ket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the req uirement. In this table, Berkshire\u2019s results through 1978 have been restated to confor m to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated u sing the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results woul d have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative r eturn. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire earned $4.0 billion in 2018 utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (commonly called\u201cGAAP\u201d). The components of that figure are $24.8 billion in operating earnings, a $3.0 billion non-cash loss from animpairment of intangible assets (arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz), $2.8 billion in realizedcapital gains from the sale of investment securities and a $20.6 billion lossfrom a reduction in the amount of unrealized capital gains that existed in our investment holdings.A new GAAP rule requires us to include that last item in earnings. As I emphasized in the 2017 annual report,neither Berkshire\u2019s Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, nor I believe that rule to be sensible. Rather, both of us haveconsistently thought that at Berkshire this mark-to-market change would produce what I described as \u201cwild andcapricious swings in our bottom line.\u201dThe accuracy of that prediction can be suggested by our quarterly results during 2018. In the first and fourthquarters, we reported GAAPlossesof $1.1 billion and $25.4 billion respectively. In the second and third quarters, wereportedprofitsof $12 billion and $18.5 billion. In complete contrast to these gyrations, the many businesses thatBerkshire owns delivered consistent and satisfactory operating earnings in allquarters. For the year, those earnings exceeded their 2016 high of $17.6 billion by 41%.Wide swings in our quarterly GAAP earnings will inevitably continue. That\u2019s because our huge equityportfolio \u2013 valued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 \u2013 will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2billion or more, all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line. Indeed, in the fourthquarter, a period of high volatility in stock prices, we experienced several days with a \u201cprofit\u201d or \u201closs\u201d of more than$4 billion.Our advice? Focus on operating earnings, paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My sayingthat in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie and I expect them todeliver substantial gains, albeit with highly irregular timing. ************Long-time readers of our annual reports will have spotted the different way in which I opened this letter. Fornearly three decades, the initial paragraph featured the percentage change in Berkshire\u2019s per-share book value. It\u2019snow time to abandon that practice.The fact is that the annual change in Berkshire\u2019s book value \u2013 which makes its farewell appearance on page2 \u2013 is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had. Three circumstances have made that so. First, Berkshire hasgradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major valueresides in operating businesses. Charlie and I expect that reshaping to continue in an irregular manner. Second, whileourequity holdingsare valued at market prices, accounting rules require our collection of operating companiesto be included in book value at an amount far below their current value, a mismark that has grown in recent years. Third, itis likely that \u2013 over time \u2013 Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares, transactions that will take place atprices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Eachtransaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down. That combination causesthe book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality.3In future tabulations of our financial results, we expect to focus on Berkshire\u2019s market price. Markets can beextremely capricious: Just look at the 54-year history laid out on page 2. Over time, however, Berkshire\u2019s stock pricewill provide the best measure of business performance. ************Before moving on, I want to give you some good news \u2013 reallygood news \u2013 that is not reflected in our financial statements. It concerns the management changes we made in early 2018, when Ajit Jain was put in chargeof all insurance activities and Greg Abel was given authority over all other operations. These moves were overdue.Berkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents,and Berkshire blood flows through their veins.Now let\u2019s take a look at what you own.Focus on the Forest \u2013 Forget the TreesInvestors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses \u2013 oureconomic \u201ctrees,\u201d so to speak. Analysis of that type can be mind-numbing, given that we own a vast array ofspecimens, ranging from twigs to redwoods. A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade fromnow. Many others, though, are destined to grow in size and beauty.Fortunately, it\u2019s not necessary to evaluate each tree individually to make a rough estimate of Berkshire\u2019sintrinsic business value. That\u2019s because our forest contains five \u201cgroves\u201d of major importance, each of which can beappraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety. Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses andfinancial assets that are easy to understand. The fifth \u2013 our huge and diverse insurance operation \u2013 delivers great valueto Berkshire in a less obvious manner, one I will explain later in this letter.Before we look more closely at the first four groves, let me remind you of our prime goal in the deploymentof your capital: to buy ably-managed businesses, in whole or part, that possess favorable and durable economic characteristics. We also need to make these purchases at sensible prices.Sometimes we can buy control of companies that meet our tests. Far more often, we find the attributes weseek in publicly-traded businesses, in which we normally acquire a 5% to 10% interest. Our two-pronged approach tohuge-scale capital allocation is rare in corporate America and, at times, gives us an important advantage.In recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more forour money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety. That disparity led us to buy about $43billion of marketable equities last year, while selling only $19 billion. Charlie and I believe the companies in whichwe invested offered excellent value, far exceeding that available in takeover transactions.Despite our recent additions to marketable equities, the most valuable grove in Berkshire\u2019s forest remains themany dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with lessthan 80%). Those subsidiaries earned $16.8 billion last year. When we say \u201cearned,\u201d moreover, we are describing whatremains afterallincome taxes, interest payments, managerial compensation (whether cash or stock-based),restructuring expenses, depreciation, amortization and home-office overhead.That brand of earnings is a far cry from that frequently touted by Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs.Too often, their presentations feature \u201cadjusted EBITDA,\u201d a measure that redefines \u201cearnings\u201d to exclude a variety ofall-too-real costs.\n4For example, managements sometimes assert that their company\u2019s stock-based compensation shouldn\u2019t becounted as an expense. (What else could it be \u2013 a giftfrom shareholders?) And restructuring expenses? Well, maybe last year\u2019s exact rearrangement won\u2019t recur. But restructurings of one sort or another are common in business \u2013Berkshire has gone down that road dozens of times, and our shareholders have always borne the costs of doing so.Abraham Lincoln once posed the question: \u201cIf you call a dog\u2019s tail a leg, how many legs does it have?\u201d andthen answered his own query: \u201cFour, because calling a tail a leg doesn\u2019t make it one.\u201d Abe would have felt lonely onWall Street.Charlie and I do contend that our acquisition-related amortization expenses of $1.4 billion (detailed on pageK-84) are not a true economic cost. We add back such amortization \u201ccosts\u201d to GAAP earnings when we are evaluatingboth private businesses and marketable stocks.In contrast, Berkshire\u2019s $8.4 billion depreciation charge understates our true economic cost. In fact, we needto spendmorethan this sum annually to simply remain competitive in our many operations. Beyond those\u201cmaintenance\u201d capital expenditures, we spend large sums in pursuit of growth. Overall, Berkshire invested a record$14.5 billion last year in plant, equipment and other fixed assets, with 89% of that spent in America.Berkshire\u2019s runner-up grove by value is its collection of equities, typically involving a 5% to 10% ownershipposition in a very large company. As noted earlier, our equity investments were worth nearly $173 billion at yearend,an amount far above their cost. If the portfolio had been sold at its yearend valuation, federal income tax of about$14.7 billion would have been payable on the gain. In all likelihood, we will hold most of these stocks for a long time.Eventually, however, gains generate taxes at whatever rate prevails at the time of sale.Our investees paid us dividends of $3.8 billion last year, a sum that will increase in 2019. Far more importantthan the dividends, though, are the huge earnings that are annually retained by these companies. Consider, as anindicator, these figures that cover only our five largest holdings.YearendOwnership\nBerkshire\u2019s Share in $ millions of Company\nDividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\nAmerican Express 17.9% $ 237 $ 997Apple 5.4% 745 2,502Bank of America 9.5% 551 2,096Coca-Cola 9.4% 624 (21)Wells Fargo 9.8% 809 1,263\nTotal $2,966 $6,837\n(1) Based on current annual rate.(2) Based on 2018 earnings minus common and preferred dividends paid.GAAP \u2013 which dictates the earnings we report \u2013 does not allow us to include the retained earnings ofinvestees in our financial accounts. But those earnings are of enormous value to us: Over the years, earnings retainedby our investees (viewed as a group) have eventually delivered capital gains to Berkshire that totaled more than onedollar for each dollar these companies reinvested for us.All of our major holdings enjoy excellent economics, and most use a portion of their retained earnings torepurchase their shares. We very much like that: If Charlie and I think an investee\u2019s stock is underpriced, we rejoicewhen management employs some of its earnings to increase Berkshire\u2019s ownership percentage.\n5Here\u2019s one example drawn from the table above: Berkshire\u2019s holdings of American Express have remainedunchanged over the past eight years. Meanwhile, our ownership increased from 12.6% to 17.9% because ofrepurchases made by the company. Last year, Berkshire\u2019s portion of the $6.9 billion earned by American Express was$1.2 billion, about 96% of the $1.3 billion we paid for our stake in the company. When earnings increase and sharesoutstanding decrease, owners \u2013 over time \u2013 usually do well.A third category of Berkshire\u2019s business ownership is a quartet of companies in which we share control withother parties. Our portion of the after-tax operating earnings of these businesses \u2013 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, 50% ofBerkadia and Electric Transmission Texas, and 38.6% of Pilot Flying J \u2013 totaled about $1.3 billion in 2018.In our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at yearend in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents,and another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments. We consider a portion of that stash to beuntouchable, having pledged to always hold at least $20 billion in cash equivalents to guard against external calamities.We have also promised to avoidanyactivities that could threaten our maintaining that buffer.Berkshire will forever remain a financial fortress. In managing, I will make expensive mistakes ofcommission and will also miss many opportunities, some of which should have been obvious to me. At times, ourstock will tumble as investors flee from equities. But I will never risk getting caught short of cash.In the years ahead, we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire willpermanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businessespossessing decent long-term prospects.That disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketableequities. We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95 \u2013 I\u2019m the young one\u2013 that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie\u2019s to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of ahuge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.)My expectation of more stock purchases isnota market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will behave next week or next year. Predictions of that sort have neverbeen a part of our activities. Our thinking, rather, is focused on calculating whether a portion of an attractive business is worth more than its market price. ************I believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value can beapproximated by summing the values of our four asset-laden groves and then subtracting an appropriate amount for taxes eventually payable on the sale of marketable securities.You may ask whether an allowance should not also be made for the major tax costs Berkshire would incur ifwe were to sell certain of our wholly-owned businesses. Forget that thought: It would be foolish for us to sell any ofour wonderful companies even ifnotax would be payable on its sale. Truly good businesses are exceptionally hard tofind. Selling any you are lucky enough to own makes no sense at all.The interest cost onallof our debt has been deducted as an expense in calculating the earnings at Berkshire\u2019snon-insurance businesses. Beyond that, much of our ownership of the first four groves is financed by funds generatedfrom Berkshire\u2019s fifth grove \u2013 a collection of exceptional insurance companies. We call those funds \u201cfloat,\u201d a sourceof financing that we expect to be cost-free \u2013 or maybe even better than that \u2013 over time. We will explain thecharacteristics of float later in this letter.Finally, a point of key and lasting importance: Berkshire\u2019s value is maximized by our having assembled thefive groves into a single entity. This arrangement allows us to seamlessly and objectively allocate major amounts ofcapital, eliminate enterprise risk, avoid insularity, fund assets at exceptionally low cost, occasionally take advantageof tax efficiencies, and minimize overhead.At Berkshire, the whole is greater \u2013 considerably greater \u2013 than the sum of the parts.6Repurchases and ReportingEarlier I mentioned that Berkshire will from time to time be repurchasing its own stock. Assuming that webuy at a discount to Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value \u2013 which certainly will be our intention \u2013 repurchases will benefit boththose shareholders leaving the company and those who stay.True, the upside from repurchases is very slight for those who are leaving. That\u2019s because careful buying byus will minimize any impact on Berkshire\u2019s stock price. Nevertheless, there is somebenefit to sellers in having an extra buyer in the market.For continuing shareholders, the advantage is obvious: If the market prices a departing partner\u2019s interest at,say, 90\u00a2 on the dollar, continuing shareholders reap an increase in per-share intrinsic value with every repurchase bythe company. Obviously, repurchases should be price-sensitive: Blindly buying an overpriced stock is value-destructive, a fact lost on many promotional or ever-optimistic CEOs.When a company says that it contemplates repurchases, it\u2019s vital that all shareholder-partners be given theinformation they need to make an intelligent estimate of value. Providing that information is what Charlie and I try todo in this report. We do not want a partner to sell shares back to the company because he or she has been misled orinadequately informed.Some sellers, however, may disagree with our calculation of value and others may have found investmentsthat they consider more attractive than Berkshire shares. Some of that second group will be right: There areunquestionably many stocks that will deliver far greater gains than ours.In addition, certain shareholders will simply decide it\u2019s time for them or their families to become netconsumers rather than continuing to build capital. Charlie and I have no current interest in joining that group. Perhapswe will become big spenders in our old age. ************For 54 years our managerial decisions at Berkshire have been made from the viewpoint of the shareholderswho are staying, not those who are leaving. Consequently, Charlie and I have neverfocused on current-quarter results. Berkshire, in fact, may be the only company in the Fortune 500 that does not prepare monthly earnings reportsor balance sheets. I, of course, regularly view the monthly financial reports of most subsidiaries. But Charlie and Ilearn of Berkshire\u2019s overall earnings and financial position only on a quarterly basis.Furthermore, Berkshire has no company-wide budget (though many of our subsidiaries find one useful). Ourlack of such an instrument means that the parent company has neverhad a quarterly \u201cnumber\u201d to hit. Shunning the use of this bogey sends an important message to our many managers, reinforcing the culture we prize.Over the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational,induced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations. What starts as an \u201cinnocent\u201d fudge in order tonot disappoint \u201cthe Street\u201d \u2013 say, trade-loading at quarter-end, turning a blind eye to rising insurance losses, or drawingdown a \u201ccookie-jar\u201d reserve \u2013 can become the first step toward full-fledged fraud. Playing with the numbers \u201cjust thisonce\u201d may well be the CEO\u2019s intent; it\u2019s seldom the end result. And if it\u2019s okay for the boss to cheat a little, it\u2019s easyfor subordinates to rationalize similar behavior.At Berkshire, our audience is neither analysts nor commentators: Charlie and I are working for ourshareholder-partners. The numbers that flow up to us will be the ones we send on to you.\n7Non-Insurance Operations \u2013 From Lollipops to LocomotivesLet\u2019s now look further at Berkshire\u2019s most valuable grove \u2013 our collection of non-insurance businesses \u2013keeping in mind that we do not wish to unnecessarily hand our competitors information that might be useful to them.Additional details about individual operations can be found on pages K-5 \u2013 K-22 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-51.Viewed as a group, these businesses earned pre-tax income in 2018 of $20.8 billion, a 24% increase over2017. Acquisitions we made in 2018 delivered only a trivial amount of that gain.I will stick with pre-tax figures in this discussion. But our after-tax gain in 2018 from these businesses wasfargreater \u2013 47%\u2013 thanks in large part to the cut in the corporate tax rate that became effective at the beginning ofthat year. Let\u2019s look at why the impact was so dramatic.Begin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U.S. Government \u201cowns\u201d an interest in Berkshire\u2019searnings of a size determined by Congress. In effect, our country\u2019s Treasury Department holds a special class of ourstock \u2013 call this holding the AA shares \u2013 that receives large \u201cdividends\u201d (that is, tax payments) from Berkshire. In2017, as in many years before, the corporate tax rate was 35%, which meant that the Treasury was doing very wellwith its AA shares. Indeed, the Treasury\u2019s \u201cstock,\u201d which was paying nothing when we took over in 1965, had evolvedinto a holding that delivered billions of dollars annually to the federal government.Last year, however, 40% of the government\u2019s \u201cownership\u201d (14/35\nths) was returned to Berkshire \u2013 free of charge \u2013 when the corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%. Consequently, our \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d shareholders received amajor boost in the earnings attributable totheirshares.This happening materially increased the intrinsic value of the Berkshire shares you and I own. The samedynamic, moreover, enhanced the intrinsic value of almost all of the stocks Berkshire holds.Those are the headlines. But there are other factors to consider that tempered our gain. For example, the taxbenefits garnered by our large utility operation get passed along to its customers. Meanwhile, the tax rate applicableto the substantial dividends we receive from domestic corporations is little changed at about 13%. (This lower rate haslong been logical because our investees have already paid tax on the earnings that they pay to us.) Overall, however,the new law made our businesses and the stocks we own considerablymore valuable. Which suggests that we return to the performance of our non-insurance businesses. Our two towering redwoodsin this grove are BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (90.9% owned). Combined, they earned $9.3 billion before taxlast year, up 6% from 2017. You can read more about these businesses on pages K-5 \u2013 K-10 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-45.Our next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), ClaytonHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate pre-tax income in 2018of $6.4 billion, up from the $5.5 billion these companies earned in 2017.The next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.4billion pre-tax last year, up from $2.1 billion in 2017.The remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns \u2013 and there are many \u2013 had pre-tax income of$3.6 billion in 2018 vs. $3.3 billion in 2017.\n8Insurance, \u201cFloat,\u201d and the Funding of BerkshireOur property/casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurance business \u2013 our fifth grove \u2013 has been the engine propellingBerkshire\u2019s growth since 1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measuredby net worth.One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry\u2019s business model: P/C insurers receivepremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severeworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 thatwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individualpolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation topremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And howit has grown, as the following table shows:Year\nFloat (in millions)*\n1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322018 122,732*Includes float arising from life, annuity and health insurance businesses . We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be verygradual \u2013 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can neverbe subject to immediate or near- term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a keycomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will neverbe compromised. If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers anunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy theuse of free money \u2013 and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it.Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorousindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. That loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry,despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns ontangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.Nevertheless, I like our own prospects. Berkshire\u2019s unrivaled financial strength allows us far more flexibilityin investing our float than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to us are alwaysan advantage and occasionally offer major opportunities. When other insurers are constrained, our choices expand.Moreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at anunderwriting profit for 15 of the past 16 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was $3.2 billion. Forthe entire 16-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27 billion, of which $2 billion was recorded in 2018.\n9That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, whoknow that the benefits of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style. ************In most cases, the funding of a business comes from two sources \u2013 debt and equity. At Berkshire, we havetwo additional arrows in the quiver to talk about, but let\u2019s first address the conventional components.We use debt sparingly. Many managers, it should be noted, will disagree with this policy, arguing thatsignificant debt juices the returns for equity owners. And these more venturesome CEOs will be right mostof the time. At rare and unpredictable intervals, however, credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-roulette equation \u2013 usually win, occasionally die \u2013 may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of acompany\u2019s upside but does not share in its downside. But that strategy would be madness for Berkshire. Rationalpeople don\u2019t risk what they have and need for what they don\u2019t have and don\u2019t need.Most of the debt you see on our consolidated balance sheet \u2013 see page K-65 \u2013 resides at our railroad andenergy subsidiaries, both of them asset-heavy companies. During recessions, the cash generation of these businessesremains bountiful. The debt they use is both appropriate for their operations and notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our level of equity capital is a different story: Berkshire\u2019s $349 billion is unmatched in corporate America. Byretaining all earnings for a very long time, and allowing compound interest to work its magic, we have amassed fundsthat have enabled us to purchase and develop the valuable groves earlier described. Had we instead followed a 100%payout policy, we would still be working with the $22 millionwith which we began fiscal 1965. Beyond using debt and equity, Berkshire has benefitted in a major way from two less-common sources ofcorporate funding. The larger is the float I have described. So far, those funds, though they are recorded as a huge netliabilityon our balance sheet, have been of more utility to us than an equivalent amount of equity. That\u2019s because theyhave usually been accompanied by underwriting earnings. In effect, we have been paidin most years for holding and using other people\u2019s money.As I have often done before, I will emphasize that this happy outcome is far from a sure thing: Mistakes inassessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years to surface. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe thatwill dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michaelwilloccur \u2013 perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. \u201cThe Big One\u201d may come from a traditional source, such as a hurricane or earthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving,say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, we will get our share of the losses and they will be big \u2013 verybig. Unlike many other insurers, however, we will be looking to add business the next day.The final funding source \u2013 which again Berkshire possesses to an unusual degree \u2013 is deferred income taxes.These are liabilities that we will eventually pay but that are meanwhile interest-free.As I indicated earlier, about $14.7 billion of our $50.5 billion of deferred taxes arises from the unrealizedgains in our equity holdings. These liabilities are accrued in our financial statements at the current 21% corporate taxrate but will be paid at the rates prevailing when our investments are sold. Between now and then, we in effect havean interest-free \u201cloan\u201d that allows us to have more money working for us in equities than would otherwise be the case.\n10A further $28.3 billion of deferred tax results from our being able to accelerate the depreciation of assets suchas plant and equipment in calculating the tax we must currently pay. The front-ended savings in taxes that we recordgradually reverse in future years. We regularly purchase additional assets, however. As long as the present tax lawprevails, this source of funding should trend upward.Over time, Berkshire\u2019s funding base \u2013 that\u2019s the right-hand side of our balance sheet \u2013 should grow, primarilythrough the earnings we retain. Our job is to put the money retained to good use on the left-hand side, by addingattractive assets.GEICO and Tony NicelyThat title says it all: The company and the man are inseparable.Tony joined GEICO in 1961 at the age of 18; I met him in the mid-1970s. At that time, GEICO, after a four-decade record of both rapid growth and outstanding underwriting results, suddenly found itself near bankruptcy. Arecently-installed management had grossly underestimated GEICO\u2019s loss costs and consequently underpriced itsproduct. It would take many months until those loss-generating policies on GEICO\u2019s books \u2013 there were no less than2.3 million of them \u2013 would expire and could then be repriced. The company\u2019s net worth in the meantime was rapidlyapproaching zero.In 1976, Jack Byrne was brought in as CEO to rescue GEICO. Soon after his arrival, I met him, concludedthat he was the perfect man for the job, and began to aggressively buy GEICO shares. Within a few months, Berkshirebought about\n1\u20443of the company, a portion that later grew to roughly1\u20442without our spending a dime. That stunning accretion occurred because GEICO, after recovering its health, consistently repurchased its shares. All told, this half-interest in GEICO cost Berkshire $47 million, about what you might pay today for a trophy apartment in New York.Let\u2019s now fast-forward 17 years to 1993, when Tony Nicely was promoted to CEO. At that point, GEICO\u2019sreputation and profitability had been restored \u2013 but not its growth. Indeed, at yearend 1992 the company had only 1.9million auto policies on its books, far less than its pre-crisis high. In sales volume among U.S. auto insurers, GEICOthen ranked an undistinguished seventh.Late in 1995, after Tony had re-energized GEICO, Berkshire made an offer to buy the remaining 50% of thecompany for $2.3 billion, about 50 times what we had paid for the first half (and people say I never pay up!). Ouroffer was successful and brought Berkshire a wonderful, but underdeveloped, company and an equally wonderfulCEO, who would move GEICO forward beyond my dreams.GEICO is now America\u2019s Number Two auto insurer, with sales 1,200% greater than it recorded in 1995.Underwriting profits have totaled $15.5 billion (pre-tax) since our purchase, and float available for investment hasgrown from $2.5 billion to $22.1 billion.By my estimate, Tony\u2019s management of GEICO has increased Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value by more than $50billion. On top of that, he is a model for everything a manager should be, helping his 40,000 associates to identify andpolish abilities they didn\u2019t realize they possessed.Last year, Tony decided to retire as CEO, and on June 30\nthhe turned that position over to Bill Roberts, his long-time partner. I\u2019ve known and watched Bill operate for several decades, and once again Tony made the rightmove. Tony remains Chairman and will be helpful to GEICO for the rest of his life. He\u2019s incapable of doing less.AllBerkshire shareholders owe Tony their thanks.Ihead the list.\n11InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We excludeour Kraft Heinz holding \u2013 325,442,152 shares \u2013 because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the \u201cequity\u201d method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries its Kraft Heinz holding ata GAAP figure of $13.8 billion, an amount reduced by our share of the large write-off of intangible assets taken byKraft Heinz in 2018. At yearend, our Kraft Heinz holding had a market value of $14 billion and a cost basis of$9.8 billion. 12/31/18\nShares* CompanyPercentage ofCompanyOwned\nCost** Market\n(in millions) 151,610,700 American Express Company.................17.9 $ 1,287 $ 14,452 255,300,329 Apple Inc................................. 5 . 4 36,044 40,271 918,919,000 Bank of America Corp....................... 9 . 5 11,650 22,642 84,488,751 The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. .......... 8 . 83,860 3,977 6,789,054 Charter Communications, Inc................. 3 . 01,210 1,935 400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company.................... 9 . 4 1,299 18,940 65,535,000 Delta Air Lines, Inc......................... 9 . 6 2,860 3,270 18,784,698 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc............... 4 . 92,380 3,138 50,661,394 JPMorgan Chase & Co...................... 1 . 5 5,605 4,946 24,669,778 Moody\u2019s Corporation.......................12.9 248 3,455 47,890,899 Southwest Airlines Co....................... 8 . 7 2,005 2,226 21,938,642 United Continental Holdings Inc............... 8 . 11,195 1,837 146,346,999 U.S. Bancorp............................. 9 . 1 5,548 6,688 43,387,980 USG Corporation..........................31.0 836 1,851 449,349,102 Wells Fargo & Company.................... 9 . 8 10,639 20,706 Others................................... 16,201 22,423\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market........ $102,867 $ 172,757\n* Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.** This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis.Charlie and I donotview the $172.8 billion detailed above as a collection of ticker symbols \u2013 a financialdalliance to be terminated because of downgrades by \u201cthe Street,\u201d expected Federal Reserve actions, possible politicaldevelopments, forecasts by economists or whatever else might be the subject du jour.

They are truly mind-blowing when compared against the return that many investors have accepted onbonds over the last decade \u2013 3% or less on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, for example.On occasion, a ridiculously-high purchase price for a given stock will cause a splendid business to become apoor investment \u2013 if not permanently, at least for a painfully long period. Over time, however, investment performanceconverges with business performance. And, as I will next spell out, the record of American business has beenextraordinary.The American TailwindOn March 11\nth, it will be 77 years since I first invested in an American business. The year was 1942, I was11, and I went all in, investing $114.75 I had begun accumulating at age six. What I bought was three shares of CitiesService preferred stock. I had become a capitalist, and it felt good.Let\u2019s now travel back through the two 77-year periods that preceded my purchase. That leaves us starting in1788, a year prior to George Washington\u2019s installation as our first president. Could anyone then have imagined whattheir new country would accomplish in only three 77-year lifetimes?During the two 77-year periods prior to 1942, the United States had grown from four million people \u2013 about\n1\u20442of 1% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 into the most powerful country on earth. In that spring of 1942, though, it faceda crisis: The U.S. and its allies were suffering heavy losses in a war that we had entered only three months earlier. Badnews arrived daily.Despite the alarming headlines, almost all Americans believed on that March 11\nththat the war would be won. Nor was their optimism limited to that victory. Leaving aside congenital pessimists, Americans believed thattheir children and generations beyond would live far better lives than they themselves had led.The nation\u2019s citizens understood, of course, that the road ahead would not be a smooth ride. It never hadbeen. Early in its history our country was tested by a Civil War that killed 4% of all American males and led PresidentLincoln to openly ponder whether \u201ca nation so conceived and so dedicated could long endure.\u201d In the 1930s, Americasuffered through the Great Depression, a punishing period of massive unemployment.Nevertheless, in 1942, when I made my purchase, the nation expected post-war growth, a belief that provedto be well-founded. In fact, the nation\u2019s achievements can best be described as breathtaking.Let\u2019s put numbers to that claim: If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&P 500 index fund, and alldividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth (pre-taxes) $606,811 on January 31, 2019 (thelatest data available before the printing of this letter). That is a gain of 5,288 for 1.Meanwhile, a $1 million investment by a tax-free institution of that time \u2013 say, a pension fund or college endowment \u2013 would have grown to about $5.3billion.Let me add one additional calculation that I believe will shock you: If that hypothetical institution had paidonly1%of assets annually to various \u201chelpers,\u201d such as investment managers and consultants, its gain would havebeencut in half, to $2.65 billion. That\u2019s what happens over 77 years when the 11.8% annual return actually achievedby the S&P 500 is recalculated at a 10.8% rate.\n13Those who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits (as I regularly did myself for manyyears) might note that our country\u2019s national debt has increased roughly 400-fold during the last of my 77-year periods.That\u2019s 40,000%! Suppose you had foreseen this increase and panicked at the prospect of runaway deficits and aworthless currency. To \u201cprotect\u201d yourself, you might have eschewed stocks and opted instead to buy 3\n1\u20444ounces of gold with your $114.75.And what would that supposed protection have delivered? You would now have an asset worth about $4,200,less than 1% of whatwould have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in American business. Themagical metal was no match for the American mettle.Our country\u2019s almost unbelievable prosperity has been gained in a bipartisan manner. Since 1942, we havehad seven Republican presidents and seven Democrats. In the years they served, the country contended at various timeswith a long period of viral inflation, a 21% prime rate, several controversial and costly wars, the resignation of apresident, a pervasive collapse in home values, a paralyzing financial panic and a host of other problems. Allengendered scary headlines; all are now history.Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, lies buried within that London church. Near his tomb areposted these words of description (translated from Latin): \u201cIf you would seek my monument, look around you.\u201d Thoseskeptical of America\u2019s economic playbook should heed his message.In 1788 \u2013 to go back to our starting point \u2013 there really wasn\u2019t much here exceptfor a small band of ambitious people and an embryonic governing framework aimed at turning their dreams into reality. Today, the Federal Reserveestimates our household wealth at $108trillion, an amount almost impossible to comprehend.Remember, earlier in this letter, how I described retained earnings as having been the key to Berkshire\u2019sprosperity? So it has been with America. In the nation\u2019s accounting, the comparable item is labeled \u201csavings.\u201d Andsave we have. If our forefathers had instead consumed all they produced, there would have been no investment, noproductivity gains and no leap in living standards. ************Charlie and I happily acknowledge that much of Berkshire\u2019s success has simply been a product of what Ithink should be calledThe American Tailwind. It is beyond arrogance for American businesses or individuals to boastthat they have \u201cdone it alone.\u201d The tidy rows of simple white crosses at Normandy should shame those who makesuch claims.There are also many other countries around the world that have bright futures. About that, we should rejoice:Americans will be both more prosperous and safer if allnations thrive. At Berkshire, we hope to invest significant sums across borders.Over the next 77 years, however, the major source of our gains will almost certainly be provided by TheAmerican Tailwind. We are lucky \u2013 gloriously lucky \u2013 to have that force at our back.\n14The Annual MeetingBerkshire\u2019s 2019 annual meeting will take place on Saturday, May 4\nth.

Andy Serwer and his Yahoo associates do anoutstanding job, both in covering the entire meeting and interviewing many Berkshire managers, celebrities, financialexperts and shareholders from the U.S. and abroad. The world\u2019s knowledge of what goes on in Omaha the firstSaturday of every May has grown dramatically since Yahoo came on board. Its coverage begins at 8:45 a.m. CDT andprovides Mandarin translation. ************For 54 years, Charlie and I have loved our jobs. Daily, we do what we find interesting, working with peoplewe like and trust. And now our new management structure has made our lives even more enjoyable.With the whole ensemble \u2013 that is, with Ajit and Greg running operations, a great collection of businesses, aNiagara of cash-generation, a cadre of talented managers and a rock-solid culture \u2013 your company is in good shapefor whatever the future brings.February 23, 2019 Warren E.

The four components of that figure are $21.9 billion of operating earnings, $4.9 billion of realizedcapital gains, a $26.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealizedcapital gains that exist in the stocks we hold and, finally, an $11 billionlossfrom a write-down in the value of a few subsidiary and affiliate businessesthat we own. All items are stated on an after-tax basis.Operating earningsare what count most, even during periods when they are notthe largest item in our GAAP total. Our focus at Berkshire is both to increase this segment of our income and to acquire large and favorably-situatedbusinesses. Last year, however, we met neither goal: Berkshire made no sizable acquisitions and operating earningsfell9%. We did, though, increase Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic value by both retaining earnings and repurchasingabout 5% of our shares.The two GAAP components pertaining to capital gains or losses (whether realized or unrealized) fluctuatecapriciously from year to year, reflecting swings in the stock market. Whatever today\u2019sfigures, Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I firmly believe that, over time, Berkshire\u2019s capital gains from its investment holdings will besubstantial.As I\u2019ve emphasized many times, Charlie and I view Berkshire\u2019s holdings of marketable stocks \u2013 at yearendworth $281 billion \u2013 as a collection ofbusinesses. We don\u2019t control the operations of those companies, but we do share proportionately in their long-term prosperity. From an accounting standpoint, however, our portion of theirearningsisnotincluded in Berkshire\u2019s income. Instead, only what these investees pay us in dividends is recorded onour books. Under GAAP, the huge sums that investees retain on our behalf become invisible.What\u2019s out of sight, however, shouldnotbe out of mind: Those unrecorded retained earnings are usually building value \u2013lotsof value \u2013 for Berkshire. Investees use the withheld funds to expand their business, makeacquisitions, pay off debt and, often, to repurchase their stock (an act that increases our share of their future earnings).As we pointed out in these pages last year, retained earnings have propelled American business throughout ourcountry\u2019s history. What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions ofshareholders as well.Of course, some of our investees will disappoint, adding little, if anything, to the value of their company byretaining earnings. But others will over-deliver, a few spectacularly. In aggregate, we expect our share of the hugepile of earnings retained by Berkshire\u2019s non-controlled businesses (what others would label our equity portfolio) toeventually deliver us an equal or greater amount of capital gains. Over our 56-year tenure, that expectation has beenmet.\n3The final component in our GAAP figure \u2013 that ugly $11 billion write-down \u2013 is almost entirely thequantification of a mistake I made in 2016. That year, Berkshire purchased Precision Castparts (\u201cPCC\u201d), and I paidtoo much for the company.No one misled me in any way \u2013 I was simply too optimistic about PCC\u2019s normalized profit potential. Lastyear, my miscalculation was laid bare by adverse developments throughout the aerospace industry, PCC\u2019s mostimportant source of customers.In purchasing PCC, Berkshire bought a fine company \u2013 the best in its business. Mark Donegan, PCC\u2019s CEO,is a passionate manager who consistently pours the same energy into the business that he did before we purchased it.We are lucky to have him running things.I believe I was right in concluding that PCC would, over time, earn good returns on the net tangible assetsdeployed in its operations. I was wrong, however, in judging the averageamount of future earnings and, consequently, wrong in my calculation of the proper price to pay for the business.PCC is far from my first error of that sort. But it\u2019s a big one.Two Strings to Our BowBerkshire is often labeled a conglomerate, a negative term applied to holding companies that own ahodge-podge of unrelated businesses. And, yes, that describes Berkshire \u2013 but only in part. To understand how andwhy we differ from the prototype conglomerate, let\u2019s review a little history.Over time, conglomerates have generally limited themselves to buying businesses in their entirety. That strategy, however, came with two major problems. One was unsolvable: Most of the truly great businesses had nointerest in havinganyonetake them over. Consequently, deal-hungry conglomerateurs had to focus on so-socompanies that lacked important and durable competitive strengths. That was not a great pond in which to fish.Beyond that, as conglomerateurs dipped into this universe of mediocre businesses, they often foundthemselves required to pay staggering \u201ccontrol\u201d premiums to snare their quarry. Aspiring conglomerateurs knew theanswer to this \u201coverpayment\u201d problem: They simply needed to manufacture a vastly overvalued stock of their ownthat could be used as a \u201ccurrency\u201d for pricey acquisitions. (\u201cI\u2019ll pay you $10,000 for your dog by giving you two ofmy $5,000 cats.\u201d)Often, the tools for fostering the overvaluation of a conglomerate\u2019s stock involved promotional techniquesand \u201cimaginative\u201d accounting maneuvers that were, at best, deceptive and that sometimes crossed the line into fraud.When these tricks were \u201csuccessful,\u201d the conglomerate pushed its own stock to, say, 3x its business value in order tooffer the target 2xitsvalue.Investing illusions can continue for a surprisingly long time. Wall Street loves the fees that deal-makinggenerates, and the press loves the stories that colorful promoters provide. At a point, also, the soaring price of apromoted stock can itself become the \u201cproof\u201d that an illusion is reality.\n4Eventually, of course, the party ends, and many business \u201cemperors\u201d are found to have no clothes. Financialhistory is replete with the names of famous conglomerateurs who were initially lionized as business geniuses byjournalists, analysts and investment bankers, but whose creations ended up as business junkyards.Conglomeratesearnedtheir terrible reputation.************Charlie and I want our conglomerate toownall or part of a diverse group of businesses with good economic characteristics and good managers. Whether Berkshire controlsthese businesses, however, is unimportant to us. It took me a while to wise up. But Charlie \u2013 and also my 20-year struggle with the textile operation I inheritedat Berkshire \u2013 finally convinced me that owning a non-controlling portion of a wonderful business is more profitable,more enjoyable andfarless work than struggling with 100% of a marginal enterprise.For those reasons,ourconglomerate will remain a collection of controlled andnon-controlled businesses. Charlie and I will simply deploy your capital into whatever we believe makes the most sense, based on a company\u2019sdurable competitive strengths, the capabilities and character of its management, and price.If that strategy requires little or no effort on our part, so much the better. In contrast to the scoring systemutilized in diving competitions, you are awarded nopoints in business endeavors for \u201cdegree of difficulty.\u201d Furthermore, as Ronald Reagan cautioned: \u201cIt\u2019s said that hard work never killed anyone, but Isay why take the chance?\u201dThe Family Jewels and How We Increase Your Share of These GemsOn page A-1 we list Berkshire\u2019s subsidiaries, a smorgasbord of businesses employing 360,000 at yearend.You can read much more about these controlled operations in the 10-K that fills the back part of this report. Our majorpositions in companies that we partly own and don\u2019tcontrol are listed on page 7 of this letter. That portfolio of businesses, too, is large and diverse.Mostof Berkshire\u2019s value, however, resides in four businesses, three controlled and one in which we haveonly a 5.4% interest. All four are jewels.The largest in value is our property/casualty insurance operation, which for 53 years has been the core ofBerkshire. Our family of insurers is unique in the insurance field. So, too, is its manager, Ajit Jain, who joinedBerkshire in 1986.Overall, the insurance fleet operates withfarmore capital than is deployed by any of its competitors worldwide. That financial strength, coupled with the huge flow of cashBerkshire annually receives from its non-insurancebusinesses, allows our insurance companies to safely follow an equity-heavy investment strategy notfeasible for the overwhelming majority of insurers. Those competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons,mustfocus on bonds.And bonds arenot the place to be these days. Can you believe that the income recently available from a10-year U.S. Treasury bond \u2013 the yield was 0.93% at yearend \u2013 had fallen 94%from the 15.8% yield available in September 1981? In certain large and important countries, such as Germany and Japan, investors earn a negativereturn on trillions of dollars of sovereign debt. Fixed-income investors worldwide \u2013 whether pension funds, insurancecompanies or retirees \u2013 face a bleak future.\n5Some insurers, as well as other bond investors, may try to juice the pathetic returns now available by shiftingtheir purchases to obligations backed by shaky borrowers. Risky loans, however, are notthe answer to inadequate interest rates. Three decades ago, the once-mighty savings and loan industry destroyed itself, partly by ignoring thatmaxim.Berkshire now enjoys $138 billion of insurance \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 funds that do not belong to us, but are neverthelessours to deploy, whether in bonds, stocks or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasury bills. Float has some similaritiesto bank deposits: cash flows in and out daily to insurers, with the total they hold changing very little. The massivesum held by Berkshire is likely to remain near its present level for many years and, on a cumulative basis, has beencostlessto us. That happy result, of course, could change \u2013 but, over time, I like our odds.I have repetitiously \u2013 some might say endlessly \u2013 explained our insurance operation in my annual letters toyou. Therefore, I will this year ask new shareholders who wish to learn more about our insurance business and \u201cfloat\u201dto read the pertinent section of the 2019 report, reprinted on page A-2. It\u2019s important that you understand the risks,as well as the opportunities, existing in our insurance activities.Our second and third most valuable assets \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much a toss-up at this point \u2013 are Berkshire\u2019s 100%ownership of BNSF, America\u2019s largest railroad measured by freight volume, and our 5.4% ownership of Apple. Andin the fourth spot is our 91% ownership of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d). What we have here is a very unusualutility business, whose annual earnings have grown from $122 million to $3.4 billionduring our 21 years of ownership. I\u2019ll have more to say about BNSF and BHE later in this letter. For now, however, I would like to focus on apractice Berkshire will periodically use to enhance yourinterest in both its \u201cBig Four\u201d as well as the many other assets Berkshire owns.************\nLast year we demonstrated our enthusiasm for Berkshire\u2019s spread of properties by repurchasing theequivalent of 80,998 \u201cA\u201d shares, spending $24.7 billion in the process. That action increased yourownership inallof Berkshire\u2019s businesses by 5.2%withoutrequiring you to so much as touch your wallet.\nFollowing criteria Charlie and I have long recommended, we made those purchases because we believed theywould both enhance the intrinsic value per share for continuing shareholders andwould leave Berkshire with more than ample funds for any opportunities or problems it might encounter.In no way do we think that Berkshire shares should be repurchased at simply any price. I emphasize thatpoint because American CEOs have an embarrassing record of devoting more company funds to repurchases whenprices have risen than when they have tanked. Our approach is exactly the reverse.Berkshire\u2019s investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases. We began buying Apple stocklate in 2016 and by early July 2018, owned slightly more than one billion Apple shares (split-adjusted). Saying that,I\u2019m referencing the investment held in Berkshire\u2019s general account and am excluding a very small andseparately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases inmid-2018, Berkshire\u2019s general account owned 5.2% of Apple.Our cost for that stake was $36 billion. Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about$775 million annually, and have also \u2013 in 2020 \u2013 pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of ourposition.Despite that sale \u2013 voila! \u2013 Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costlessto us, coming about because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now hasoutstanding.\n6But that\u2019s far from all of the good news. Because we also repurchased Berkshireshares during the 21\u20442years, younow indirectly own a full 10% more of Apple\u2019s assets and future earnings than you did in July 2018.This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely tofurther reduce its share count in the future. Apple has publicly stated an intention to repurchase its shares as well. Asthese reductions occur, Berkshire shareholders will not only own a greater interest in our insurance group and in BNSFand BHE, but will also find their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.The math of repurchases grinds away slowly, but can be powerful over time. The process offers a simple wayfor investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses.And as a sultry Mae West assured us: \u201cToo much of a good thing can be . . . wonderful.\u201d InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend were our largest in market value. Weexclude our Kraft Heinz holding \u2014 325,442,152 shares \u2014 because Berkshire is part of a control group and thereforemust account for that investment using the \u201cequity\u201d method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries the Kraft Heinzholding at a GAAP figure of $13.3 billion, an amount that represents Berkshire\u2019s share of the audited net worth ofKraft Heinz on December 31, 2020. Please note, though, that the market value of our shares on that date was only$11.3 billion. 12/31/20Shares*\nCompanyPercentage ofCompanyOwned\nCost** Market\n(in millions) 25,533,082 AbbVie Inc................................ 1 . 4 $ 2,333 $ 2,736 151,610,700 American Express Company..................18.8 1,287 18,331 907,559,761 Apple Inc.................................. 5 . 4 31,089 120,424 1,032,852,006 Bank of America Corp.......................11.9 14,631 31,306 66,835,615 The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ........... 7 . 52,918 2,837 225,000,000 BYD Co.

Since our country\u2019s birth, individuals with an idea, ambitionand often just a pittance of capital have succeeded beyond their dreams by creating something new or by improvingthe customer\u2019s experience with something old.Charlie and I journeyed throughout the nation to join with many of these individuals or their families. On theWest Coast, we began the routine in 1972 with our purchase of See\u2019s Candy. A full century ago, Mary See set out todeliver an age-old product that she had reinvented with special recipes. Added to her business plan were quaint storesstaffed by friendly salespeople. Her first small outlet in Los Angeles eventually led to several hundred shops, spreadthroughout the West.Today, Mrs. See\u2019s creations continue to delight customers while providing life-long employment forthousands of women and men. Berkshire\u2019s job is simply not to meddle with the company\u2019s success. When a businessmanufactures and distributes a non-essential consumer product, the customeris the boss. And, after 100 years, the customer\u2019s message to Berkshire remains clear: \u201cDon\u2019t mess with mycandy.\u201d (The website is https://www.sees.com/; try the peanut brittle.)Let\u2019s move across the continent to Washington, D.C. In 1936, Leo Goodwin, along with his wife, Lillian,became convinced that auto insurance \u2013 a standardized product customarily purchased from agents \u2013 could be solddirectly at a much lower price. Armed with $100,000, the pair took on giant insurers possessing 1,000 times or moretheir capital. Government Employees Insurance Company (later shortened to GEICO) was on its way.By luck, I was exposed to the company\u2019s potential a full 70 years ago. It instantly became my first love (ofan investment sort). You know the rest of the story: Berkshire eventually became the 100% owner of GEICO, whichat 84 years of age is constantly fine-tuning \u2013 but not changing \u2013 the vision of Leo and Lillian.There has been, however, a change in the company\u2019s size. In 1937, its first full year of operation, GEICO did$238,288 of business. Last year the figure was $35 billion.************Today, with much of finance, media, government and tech located in coastal areas, it\u2019s easy to overlook themany miracles occurring in middle America. Let\u2019s focus on two communities that provide stunning illustrations ofthe talent and ambition existingthroughoutour country.You will not be surprised that I begin with Omaha.In 1940, Jack Ringwalt, a graduate of Omaha\u2019s Central High School (the alma mater as well of Charlie, mydad, my first wife, our three children and two grandchildren), decided to start a property/casualty insurance companyfunded by $125,000 in capital.\nJack\u2019s dream was preposterous, requiring his pipsqueak operation \u2013 somewhat pompously christened asNational Indemnity \u2013 to compete with giant insurers, all of which operated with abundant capital. Additionally, thosecompetitors were solidly entrenched with nationwide networks of well-funded and long-established local agents.Under Jack\u2019s plan, National Indemnity, unlike GEICO, would itself use whatever agencies deigned to accept it andconsequently enjoynocost advantage in its acquisition of business. To overcome those formidable handicaps,National Indemnity focused on \u201codd-ball\u201d risks, which were deemed unimportant by the \u201cbig boys.\u201d And, improbably,the strategy succeeded.\nJack was honest, shrewd, likeable and a bit quirky. In particular, he disliked regulators. When he periodicallybecame annoyed with their supervision, he would feel an urge to sell his company.8Fortunately, I was nearby on one of those occasions. Jack liked the idea of joining Berkshire, and we made adeal in 1967, taking all of 15 minutes to reach a handshake. I never asked for an audit.Today National Indemnity is theonlycompany in the world prepared to insure certain giant risks. And, yes,it remains based in Omaha, a few miles from Berkshire\u2019s home office.Over the years, we have purchased four additional businesses from Omaha families, the best known amongthem being Nebraska Furniture Mart (\u201cNFM\u201d). The company\u2019s founder, Rose Blumkin (\u201cMrs. B\u201d), arrived in Seattlein 1915 as a Russian emigrant, unable to read or speak English. She settled in Omaha several years later and by 1936had saved $2,500 with which to start a furniture store.Competitors and suppliers ignored her, and for a time their judgment seemed correct: World War II stalledher business, and at yearend 1946, the company\u2019s net worth had grown to only $72,264. Cash, both in the till and ondeposit, totaled $50 (that\u2019s not a typo).One invaluable asset, however, went unrecorded in the 1946 figures: Louie Blumkin, Mrs. B\u2019s only son, hadrejoined the store after four years in the U.S. Army. Louie fought at Normandy\u2019s Omaha Beach following the D-Dayinvasion, earned a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in the Battle of the Bulge, and finally sailed home in November1945.Once Mrs. B and Louie were reunited, there was no stopping NFM. Driven by their dream, mother and sonworked days, nights and weekends. The result was a retailing miracle.By 1983, the pair had created a business worth $60 million. That year, on my birthday, Berkshire purchased80% of NFM, again without an audit. I counted on Blumkin family members to run the business; the third and fourthgeneration do so today. Mrs. B, it should be noted, worked daily until she was 103 \u2013 a ridiculously prematureretirement age as judged by Charlie and me.NFM now owns the three largest home-furnishings stores in the U.S. Each set a sales record in 2020, a featachieved despite the closing of NFM\u2019s stores for more than six weeks because of COVID-19.A post-script to this story says it all: When Mrs. B\u2019s large family gathered for holiday meals, she alwaysasked that they sing a song before eating. Her selection never varied: Irving Berlin\u2019s \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d************Let\u2019s move somewhat east to Knoxville, the third largest city in Tennessee. There, Berkshire has ownershipintworemarkable companies \u2013 Clayton Homes (100% owned) and Pilot Travel Centers (38% owned now, but headedfor 80% in 2023).Each company was started by a young man who had graduated from the University of Tennessee and stayedput in Knoxville. Neither had a meaningful amount of capital nor wealthy parents.But, so what? Today, Clayton and Pilot each have annualpre-tax earnings of more than$1 billion. Together they employ about 47,000 men and women.Jim Clayton, after several other business ventures, founded Clayton Homes on a shoestring in 1956, and \u201cBigJim\u201d Haslam started what became Pilot Travel Centers in 1958 by purchasing a service station for $6,000. Each of themen later brought into the business a son with the same passion, values and brains as his father. Sometimes there is amagic to genes.\n9\u201cBig Jim\u201d Haslam, now 90, has recently authored an inspirational book in which he relates how Jim Clayton\u2019s son, Kevin, encouraged the Haslams to sell a large portion of Pilot to Berkshire. Every retailer knows that satisfiedcustomers are a store\u2019s best salespeople. That\u2019s true when businesses are changing hands as well.************When you next fly over Knoxville or Omaha, tip your hat to the Claytons, Haslams and Blumkins as well asto the army of successful entrepreneurs who populate every part of our country. These builders needed America\u2019sframework for prosperity \u2013 a unique experiment when it was crafted in 1789 \u2013 to achieve their potential. In turn,America needed citizens like Jim C., Jim H., Mrs. B and Louie to accomplish the miracles our founding fathers sought.Today, many people forge similar miraclesthroughoutthe world, creating a spread of prosperity that benefits allof humanity. In its brief 232 years of existence, however, there has been noincubator for unleashing human potential like America. Despite some severe interruptions, our country\u2019s economic progress has been breathtaking.Beyond that, we retain our constitutional aspiration of becoming \u201ca more perfect union.\u201d Progress on thatfront has been slow, uneven and often discouraging. We have, however, moved forward and will continue to do so.Our unwavering conclusion:Neverbet against America.The Berkshire PartnershipBerkshire is a Delaware corporation, and our directors must follow the state\u2019s laws. Among them is arequirement that board membersmustact in the best interest of the corporation and its stockholders. Our directorsembrace that doctrine.In addition, of course, Berkshire directors want the company to delight its customers, to develop and rewardthe talents of its 360,000 associates, to behave honorably with lenders and to be regarded as a good citizen of the manycities and states in which we operate. We value these four important constituencies.None of these groups, however, have avotein determining such matters as dividends, strategic direction, CEO selection, or acquisitions and divestitures. Responsibilities like those fall solelyon Berkshire\u2019s directors, who must faithfully represent the long-term interests of the corporation and its owners. Beyond legal requirements, Charlie and I feel a special obligation to the many individualshareholders of Berkshire. A bit of personal history may help you to understand our unusual attachment and how it shapes ourbehavior.************Before my Berkshire years, I managed money for many individuals through a series of partnerships, the firstthree of those formed in 1956. As time passed, the use of multiple entities became unwieldy and, in 1962, weamalgamated 12 partnerships into a single unit, Buffett Partnership Ltd. (\u201cBPL\u201d).By that year, virtually all of my own money, and that of my wife as well, had become invested alongside thefunds of my many limited partners. I received no salary or fees. Instead, as the general partner, I was compensated bymy limited partners only after they secured returns above an annual threshold of 6%. If returns failed to meet thatlevel, the shortfall was to be carried forward against my share of future profits. (Fortunately, that never happened:Partnership returns always exceeded the 6% \u201cbogey.\u201d) As the years went by, a large part of the resources of myparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws became invested in the partnership.\n10Charlie formed his partnership in 1962 and operated much as I did. Neither of us had anyinstitutional investors, and very few of our partners were financially sophisticated. The people who joined our ventures simplytrusted us to treat their money as we treated our own. These individuals \u2013 either intuitively or by relying on the adviceof friends \u2013 correctly concluded that Charlie and I had an extreme aversion to permanent loss of capital and that wewould not have accepted their money unless we expected to do reasonably well with it.I stumbled intobusinessmanagement after BPL acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. Later still, in 1969,we decided to dissolve BPL. After yearend, the partnership distributed, pro-rata, all of its cash along with three stocks,the largest by value being BPL\u2019s 70.5% interest in Berkshire.Charlie, meanwhile, wound up his operation in 1977. Among the assets he distributed to partners was a majorinterest in Blue Chip Stamps, a company his partnership, Berkshire and I jointly controlled. Blue Chip was also amongthe three stocks my partnership had distributed upon its dissolution.In 1983, Berkshire and Blue Chip merged, thereby expanding Berkshire\u2019s base of registered shareholdersfrom 1,900 to 2,900. Charlie and I wanted everyone \u2013 old, new and prospectiveshareholders \u2013 to be on the same page. Therefore, the 1983 annual report \u2013 up front \u2013 laid out Berkshire\u2019s \u201cmajor business principles.\u201d The first principle began: \u201cAlthough our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership.\u201d That defined our relationship in 1983;it defines it today. Charlie and I \u2013 and our directors as well \u2013 believe this dictum will serve Berkshire well for manydecades to come.************Ownership of Berkshire now resides in five large \u201cbuckets,\u201d one occupied by me as a \u201cfounder\u201d of sorts.That bucket is certain to empty as the shares I own are annually distributed to various philanthropies.Two of the remaining four buckets are filled by institutional investors, each handling other people\u2019s money. That, however, is where the similarity between those buckets ends: Their investing procedures could not be moredifferent.In one institutional bucket are index funds, a large and mushrooming segment of the investment world. Thesefunds simply mimic the index that they track. The favorite of index investors is the S&P 500, of which Berkshire is acomponent. Index funds, it should be emphasized, own Berkshire shares simply because they are requiredto do so. They are on automatic pilot, buying and selling onlyfor \u201cweighting\u201d purposes.In the other institutional bucket are professionals who managetheir clients\u2019 money, whether those funds belong to wealthy individuals, universities, pensioners or whomever. These professional managers have a mandate tomove funds from one investment to another based on their judgment as to valuation and prospects. That is anhonorable, though difficult, occupation.We are happy to work for this \u201cactive\u201d group, while they meanwhile search for a better place to deploy thefunds of their clientele. Some managers, to be sure, have a long-term focus and trade very infrequently. Others usecomputers employing algorithms that may direct the purchase or sale of shares in a nano-second. Some professionalinvestors will come and go based upon their macro-economic judgments.Our fourth bucket consists of individual shareholders who operate in a manner similar to the activeinstitutional managers I\u2019ve just described. These owners, understandably, think of their Berkshire shares as a possiblesource of funds when they see another investment that excites them. We have no quarrel with that attitude, which issimilar to the way we look atsomeof the equities we own at Berkshire.\n11All of that said, Charlie and I would be less than human if we did not feel a special kinship with our fifthbucket: the million-plusindividualinvestors who simply trust us to represent their interests, whatever the future maybring. They have joined us with no intent to leave, adopting a mindset similar to that held by our original partners.Indeed, many investors from our partnership years, and/or their descendants, remain substantial owners of Berkshire.A prototype of those veterans is Stan Truhlsen, a cheerful and generous Omaha ophthalmologist as well aspersonal friend, who turned 100 on November 13, 2020. In 1959, Stan, along with 10 other young Omaha doctors,formed a partnership with me. The docs creatively labeled their venture Emdee, Ltd. Annually, they joined my wifeand me for a celebratory dinner at our home.When our partnership distributed its Berkshire shares in 1969, allof the doctors kept the stock they received. They may not have known the ins and outs of investing or accounting, but they didknow that at Berkshire they would be treated as partners.Two of Stan\u2019s comrades from Emdee are now in their high-90s and continue to hold Berkshire shares. Thisgroup\u2019s startling durability \u2013 along with the fact that Charlie and I are 97 and 90, respectively \u2013 serves up an interestingquestion: Could it be that Berkshire ownership fosters longevity?************Berkshire\u2019s unusual and valued family of individual shareholders may add to your understanding of ourreluctance to court Wall Street analysts and institutional investors. We already havethe investors we want and don\u2019t think that they, on balance, would be upgraded by replacements.\nThere are only so many seats \u2013 that is, shares outstanding \u2013 available for Berkshire ownership. And we verymuch like the people already occupying them.\nOf course, some turnover in \u201cpartners\u201d will occur. Charlie and I hope, however, that it will be minimal. Who,after all, seeks rapid turnover in friends, neighbors or marriage?In 1958, Phil Fisher wrote a superb book on investing. In it, he analogized running a public company tomanaging a restaurant. If you are seeking diners, he said, you can attract a clientele and prosper featuring either hamburgers served with a Cokeora French cuisine accompanied by exotic wines. But you must not, Fisher warned,capriciously switch from one to the other: Your message to potential customers must be consistent with what they willfind upon entering your premises.At Berkshire, we have been serving hamburgers and Coke for 56 years. We cherish the clientele this fare hasattracted.The tens of millions of other investors and speculators in the United States and elsewhere have a wide varietyof equity choices to fittheirtastes. They will find CEOs and market gurus with enticing ideas. If they want pricetargets, managed earnings and \u201cstories,\u201d they will not lack suitors. \u201cTechnicians\u201d will confidently instruct them as towhat some wiggles on a chart portend for a stock\u2019s next move. The calls for action will never stop.Many of those investors, I should add, will do quite well. After all, ownership of stocks is very much a\u201cpositive-sum\u201d game. Indeed, a patient and level-headed monkey, who constructs a portfolio by throwing 50 darts ata board listing all of the S&P 500, will \u2013over time\u2013 enjoy dividends and capital gains, just as long as it nevergets tempted to make changes in its original \u201cselections.\u201d\n12Productive assets such as farms, real estate and, yes, business ownership producewealth \u2013 lots of it. Most owners of such properties will be rewarded. All that\u2019s required is the passage of time, an inner calm, amplediversification and a minimization of transactions and fees. Still, investors must never forget that their expensesare Wall Street\u2019sincome. And, unlike my monkey, Wall Streeters do not work for peanuts.When seats open up at Berkshire \u2013 and we hope they are few \u2013 we want them to be occupied by newcomerswho understand and desire what we offer. After decades of management, Charlie and I remain unable to promiseresults. Wecananddo, however, pledge to treat you as partners.And so, too, will our successors.A Berkshire Number that May Surprise You\nRecently, I learned a fact about our company that I had never suspected: Berkshire owns American-based property, plant and equipment \u2013 the sort of assets that make up the \u201cbusiness infrastructure\u201d of our country \u2013 with aGAAP valuation exceeding the amount owned by anyother U.S. company. Berkshire\u2019s depreciated cost of these domestic\u201cfixed assets\u201d is $154 billion. Next in line on this list is AT&T, with property, plant and equipment of $127billion.\nOur leadership in fixed-asset ownership, I should add, does not, in itself, signal an investment triumph. The bestresults occur at companies that requireminimalassets to conduct high-margin businesses \u2013andoffer goods or services that will expand their sales volume with only minor needs for additional capital. We, in fact, own a few ofthese exceptional businesses, but they are relatively small and, at best, grow slowly.\nAsset-heavy companies, however, can begoodinvestments. Indeed, we are delighted with our two giants \u2013 BNSF and BHE: In 2011, Berkshire\u2019s first full year of BNSF ownership, the two companies had combinedearnings of $4.2 billion. In 2020, a tough year for many businesses, the pair earned $8.3 billion.\nBNSF and BHE will require major capital expenditures for decades to come. The good news is that both arelikely to deliver appropriate returns on the incremental investment.Let\u2019s look first at BNSF. Your railroad carries about 15% of all non-local ton-miles (a ton of freight movedone mile) of goods that move in the United States, whether by rail, truck, pipeline, barge or aircraft. By a significantmargin, BNSF\u2019s loads top those of any other carrier.The history of American railroads is fascinating. After 150 years or so of frenzied construction, skullduggery,overbuilding, bankruptcies, reorganizations and mergers, the railroad industry finally emerged a few decades ago asmature and rationalized.BNSF began operations in 1850 with a 12-mile line in northeastern Illinois. Today, it has 390 antecedentswhose railroads have been purchased or merged. The company\u2019s extensive lineage is laid out athttp://www.bnsf.com/bnsf-resources/pdf/about-bnsf/History_and_Legacy.pdf.\nBerkshire acquired BNSF early in 2010. Since our purchase, the railroad has invested $41 billion in fixedassets, an outlay $20 billion in excess of its depreciation charges. Railroading is an outdoor sport, featuring mile-longtrains obliged to reliably operate in both extreme cold and heat, as they all the while encounter every form of terrainfrom deserts to mountains. Massive flooding periodically occurs. BNSF owns 23,000 miles of track, spread throughout28 states, and must spend whatever it takes to maximize safety and service throughout its vast system.\n13Nevertheless, BNSF has paid substantial dividends to Berkshire \u2013 $41.8 billion in total. The railroad pays us,however, only what remains after it both fulfills the needs of its business and maintains a cash balance of about$2 billion. This conservative policy allows BNSF to borrow at low rates, independent of any guarantee of its debt byBerkshire.\nOne further word about BNSF: Last year, Carl Ice, its CEO, and his number two, Katie Farmer, did anextraordinary job in controlling expenses while navigating a significant downturn in business. Despite a 7% declinein the volume of goods carried, the two actually increased BNSF\u2019s profit margin by 2.9 percentage points. Carl, aslong planned, retired at yearend and Katie took over as CEO. Your railroad is in good hands.BHE, unlike BNSF, paysnodividends on its common stock, a highly-unusual practice in the electric-utilityindustry. That Spartan policy has been the case throughout our 21 years of ownership. Unlike railroads, our country\u2019selectric utilities need a massive makeover in which the ultimate costs will be staggering. The effort will absorb all ofBHE\u2019s earnings for decades to come. We welcome the challenge and believe the added investment will beappropriately rewarded.\nLet me tell you about one of BHE\u2019s endeavors \u2013 its $18 billion commitment to rework and expand asubstantial portion of the outdated grid that now transmits electricity throughout the West. BHE began this project in2006 and expects it to be completed by 2030 \u2013 yes, 2030.\nThe advent of renewable energy made our project a societal necessity. Historically, the coal-based generationof electricity that long prevailed was located close to huge centers of population. The best sites for the new world ofwind and solar generation, however, are often in remote areas. When BHE assessed the situation in 2006, it was nosecret that a huge investment in western transmission lines had to be made. Very few companies or governmentalentities, however, were in a financial position to raise their hand after they tallied the project\u2019s cost.BHE\u2019s decision to proceed, it should be noted, was based upon its trust in America\u2019s political, economic andjudicial systems. Billions of dollars needed to be invested before meaningful revenue would flow. Transmission lineshad to cross the borders of states and other jurisdictions, each with its own rules and constituencies. BHE would alsoneed to deal with hundreds of landowners and execute complicated contracts with both the suppliers that generatedrenewable power and the far-away utilities that would distribute the electricity to their customers. Competing interestsand defenders of the old order, along with unrealistic visionaries desiring an instantly-new world, had to be brought onboard.Both surprises and delays were certain. Equally certain, however, was the fact that BHE had the managerialtalent, the institutional commitment and the financial wherewithal to fulfill its promises. Though it will be many yearsbefore our western transmission project is completed, we are today searching for other projects of similar size to takeon.Whatever the obstacles, BHE will be a leader in delivering ever-cleaner energy.The Annual MeetingLast year, on February 22\nnd, I wrote you about our plans for a gala annual meeting. Within a month, theschedule was junked.Our home office group, led by Melissa Shapiro and Marc Hamburg, Berkshire\u2019s CFO, quickly regrouped.Miraculously, their improvisations worked. Greg Abel, one of Berkshire\u2019s Vice Chairmen, joined me on stage facinga dark arena, 18,000 empty seats and a camera. There was no rehearsal: Greg and I arrived about 45 minutes before\u201cshowtime.\u201d\n14Debbie Bosanek, my incredible assistant who joined Berkshire 47 years ago at age 17, had put together about25 slides displaying various facts and figures that I had assembled at home. An anonymous but highly-capable teamof computer and camera operators projected the slides onto the screen in proper order.Yahoo streamed the proceedings to a record-sized international audience. Becky Quick of CNBC, operatingfrom her home in New Jersey, selected questions from thousands that shareholders had earlier submitted or thatviewers had emailed to her during the four hours Greg and I were on stage. See\u2019s peanut brittle and fudge, along withCoca-Cola, provided us with nourishment.This year, on May 1\nst, we are planning to go one better. Again, we will rely on Yahoo and CNBC to performflawlessly. Yahoo will go live at 1 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (\u201cEDT\u201d). Simply navigate tohttps://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream.\nOur formal meeting will commence at 5:00 p.m. EDT and should finish by 5:30 p.m. Earlier, between1:30-5:00, we will answer your questions as relayed by Becky. As always, we will have no foreknowledge as to whatquestions will be asked. Send your zingers to BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com. Yahoo will wrap things up after 5:30.\nAnd now \u2013 drum roll, please \u2013 a surprise. This year our meeting will be held in Los Angeles ...a n dCharlie will be on stage with meoffering answers and observations throughout the 3\n1\u20442-hour question period. I missed him last year and, more important,youclearly missed him. Our other invaluable vice-chairmen, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, willbe with us to answer questions relating to their domains.\nJoin us via Yahoo. Direct your really tough questions to Charlie! We will have fun, and we hope you will aswell.\nBetter yet, of course, will be the day when we see you face to face. I hope and expect that will be in 2022.The citizens of Omaha, our exhibiting subsidiaries and all of us at the home office can\u2019t wait to get you back for anhonest-to-God annual meeting,Berkshire-style.February 27, 2021 Warren E.

We arehonored by your trust.Our position carries with it the responsibility to report to you what we would like to know if wewere the absentee owner andyouwere the manager. We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, andthrough the annual meeting as well.Our policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor largeinstitutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order tomaximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday.A wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files withthe S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 \u2013 K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; otherswill simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire.Alas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing theintrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be.What You OwnBerkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second grouplargely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S.equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities.Whatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesseswith both durable economic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectationsabout their long-termbusinessperformance andnotbecause we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That point is crucial: Charlie and I arenotstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.I make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises thathave truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that aremarginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that \u2013 on occasion \u2013 it becomes easy to buy piecesof wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is veryrare in negotiated transactions and never occursen masse. It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the marketable arena.\n3Surprise, SurpriseHere are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:\u2022 Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financialassets. In truth, Berkshire owns andoperatesmore U.S.-based \u201cinfrastructure\u201d assets \u2013 classified on our balance sheet asproperty, plant and equipment \u2013 than are owned and operated by anyother American corporation. That supremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.At yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire\u2019s balance sheet at $158 billion.That number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire alwayswill be building. \u2022 Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid$3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported totalcorporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion. Additionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. \u201cI gave at the office\u201d is an unassailableassertion when made by Berkshire shareholders.Berkshire\u2019s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership betweengovernment and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning andHathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, thesevenerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination.The Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that \u201cThe combination of the resources andmanagements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.\u201d Thatupbeat view was endorsed by the company\u2019s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, thatLehman Brothers). I\u2019m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the unionwas consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholdersreaped a disaster.In the nine years following the merger, Berkshire\u2019s owners watched the company\u2019s net worth crater from$51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well. Berkshire\u2019s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered anextended and non-reversible death march.During the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire\u2019s troubles. All told, thecompany paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period \u2013 a pathetic $100 per day. Early in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash andsteered essentiallyallearnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through theyears. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholdersprospered.Berkshire\u2019s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their \u201csilentpartner,\u201d the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billionsof dollars from the company in income tax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 milliondaily to the Treasury.\n4In fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge \u2013 indeed trumpet \u2013 the factthat Berkshire\u2019s prosperity has been fostered mightilybecause the company has operated in America. Our country would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 withoutBerkshire. Absent our American home, however, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, saythanks.\u2022 From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader ininsurance \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 money we hold and can invest but that does notbelong to us. Including a relatively small sum derived from life insurance, Berkshire\u2019s total float has grown from $19 millionwhen we entered the insurance business to $147billion.So far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurancelosses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overallwe have earned a modest 55-year profit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.Of equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,but their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we cantherefore think long-term.If you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. Tomy surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire ownersthough isnotreflected in our GAAP (\u201cgenerally-accepted accounting principles\u201d) presentation of earningsand net worth.Much of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire\u2019s good luck in my 1986 hiring ofAjit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience hadbeen. He replied, \u201cNone.\u201dI said, \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect,\u201d and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually wasas perfect a choice as could have been made. Better yet, he continues to be \u2013 35 years later.One final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely \u2013 but farfrom assured \u2013 that Berkshire\u2019s float can be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. I am certain, however, that there will be some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums.Berkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer \u2013 and that priority will remain longafter Charlie and I are gone.Our Four GiantsThrough Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have acollection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations,ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.\u2022 Nevertheless, operations of our \u201cBig Four\u201d companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire\u2019s value.Leading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massivefloat value we earlier described. The invested assets of these insurers are further enlarged by the extraordinaryamount of capital we invest to back up their promises.\n5The insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volumewill generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will foreverbe important. Our company can andwillbehave well. There are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire\u2019soperation, however, would be almost impossible.\u2022 Apple \u2013 our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value \u2013 is a different sort of holding. Here,our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. Butconsider that each0.1%of Apple\u2019s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million. We spentnoBerkshire funds to gain our accretion. Apple\u2019s repurchases did the job.It\u2019s important to understand that only dividendsfrom Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire reports \u2013 and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our \u201cshare\u201d of Apple\u2019s earnings amountedto a staggering $5.6billion. Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an actwe applaud. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his firstlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim\u2019s managerial touch as well.\u2022 BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it anindispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries wereinstead hauled by truck, America\u2019s carbon emissions would soar.Your railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about theold-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated afterinterest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive \u201cadjustments\u201d toearnings \u2013 to use a polite description \u2013 have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks haverisen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..)BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishmentsfar exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad.\u2022 BHE, our final Giant, earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That\u2019s up more than 30-fold from the $122 million earned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns 91.1% of thecompany.BHE\u2019s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company hadnowind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant inthe huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol\u2019s and Greg Abel\u2019s leadership, BHE hasbecome a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmissionthroughout much of the United States.Greg\u2019s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is notin any way one of those currently-fashionable \u201cgreen-washing\u201d stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing itsplans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since 2007. To further review this information, visit BHE\u2019s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that thecompany haslongbeen making climate-conscious moves that soak up allof its earnings. More opportunities lie ahead. BHE has the management, the experience, the capital and the appetite for the huge power projectsthat our country needs.\n6InvestmentsNow let\u2019s talk about companies wedon\u2019tcontrol, a list that again references Apple. Below we list our fifteen largest equity holdings, several of which are selections of Berkshire\u2019s two long-time investment managers, ToddCombs and Ted Weschler. At yearend, this valued pair had totalauthority in respect to $34 billion of investments, many of which do not meet the threshold value we use in the table. Also, a significant portion of the dollars that Toddand Ted manage are lodged in various pension plans of Berkshire-owned businesses, with the assets of these plans not included in this table. 12/31/21Shares\nCompanyPercentage ofCompanyOwned\nCost* Market\n(in millions) 151,610,700 American Express Company ....................19.9 1,287 24,804 907,559,761 Apple Inc................................... 5 . 6 31,089 161,155 1,032,852,006 Bank of America Corp. ........................12.8 14,631 45,952 66,835,615 The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ............ 8 . 3 2,918 3,882 225,000,000 BYD Co.

Earlyin 2023, Berkshire will purchase an additional interest in Pilot that will raise our ownership to 80% and lead to ourfully consolidating Pilot\u2019s earnings, assets and liabilities in our financial statements.\n7U.S. Treasury BillsBerkshire\u2019s balance sheet includes $144 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding the holdings ofBNSF and BHE). Of this sum, $120 billion is held in U.S. Treasury bills, all maturing in less than a year. That stakeleaves Berkshire financing about\n1\u20442of 1% of the publicly-held national debt.Charlie and I have pledged that Berkshire (along with our subsidiaries other than BNSF and BHE) will alwayshold more than $30 billion of cash and equivalents. We want your company to be financially impregnable and never dependent on the kindness of strangers (or even that of friends). Both of us like to sleep soundly, and we want ourcreditors, insurance claimants andyouto do so as well.But $144 billion?That imposing sum, I assure you, is not some deranged expression of patriotism. Nor have Charlie and I lostour overwhelming preference forbusinessownership. Indeed, I first manifested my enthusiasm for that 80 years ago, on March 11, 1942, when I purchased three shares of Cities Services preferred stock. Their cost was $114.75 andrequiredallof my savings. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average that day closed at 99, a fact that should scream to you:Neverbet against America.)After my initial plunge, I always kept at least 80% of my net worth in equities. My favoredstatus throughout that period was 100% \u2013 and still is. Berkshire\u2019s current 80%-or-so position in businesses is a consequence of myfailure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.Charlie and I have endured similar cash-heavy positions from time to time in the past. These periods arenever pleasant; they are also never permanent. And, fortunately, we have had a mildly attractive alternative during2020 and 2021 for deploying capital. Read on.Share RepurchasesThere are three ways that we can increase the value of your investment. The first is alwaysfront and center in our minds: Increase the long-term earning power of Berkshire\u2019s controlled businesses through internal growth orby making acquisitions. Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions. The size of thoseopportunities, however, is small compared to Berkshire\u2019s resources.Our second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that arepublicly traded. From time to time, such possibilities are both numerous and blatantly attractive. Today, though, wefind little that excites us.That\u2019s largely because of a truism: Long-term interest rates that are low push the prices of allproductive investments upward, whether these are stocks, apartments, farms, oil wells, whatever. Other factors influencevaluations as well, but interest rates will always be important.Our final path to value creation is to repurchase Berkshire shares. Through that simple act, we increase your share of the many controlledandnon-controlled businesses Berkshire owns. When the price/value equation is right,this path is the easiest and most certain way for us to increase your wealth. (Alongside the accretion of value tocontinuing shareholders, a couple of other parties gain: Repurchases are modestly beneficial to the seller of therepurchased shares and to society as well.)\n8Periodically, as alternative paths become unattractive, repurchases make good sense for Berkshire\u2019s owners.During the past two years, we therefore repurchased 9%of the shares that were outstanding at yearend 2019 for a total cost of $51.7 billion. That expenditure left our continuing shareholders owning about 10%more ofallBerkshire businesses, whether these are wholly-owned (such as BNSF and GEICO) or partly-owned (such as Coca-Cola andMoody\u2019s).I want to underscore that for Berkshire repurchases to make sense, our shares mustoffer appropriate value. We don\u2019t want to overpay for the shares of other companies, and it would be value-destroyingif we were to overpay when we are buying Berkshire. As of February 23, 2022, since yearend we repurchased additional shares at a cost of$1.2 billion. Our appetite remains large but will always remain price-dependent.It should be noted that Berkshire\u2019s buyback opportunities are limited becauseof its high-class investor base. If our shares were heavily held by short-term speculators, both price volatility and transaction volumes wouldmaterially increase. That kind of reshaping would offer us far greater opportunities for creating value by makingrepurchases. Nevertheless, Charlie and I far prefer the owners we have, even though their admirable buy-and-keepattitudes limit the extent to which long-term shareholders can profit from opportunistic repurchases.Finally, one easily-overlooked value calculation specific to Berkshire: As we\u2019ve discussed, insurance \u201cfloat\u201dof the right sort is of great value to us. As it happens, repurchases automatically increase the amount of \u201cfloat\u201d per share. That figure has increased during the past two years by 25% \u2013 going from $79,387 per \u201cA\u201d share to $99,497, ameaningful gain that, as noted, owes some thanks to repurchases.A Wonderful Man and a Wonderful BusinessLast year, Paul Andrews died. Paul was the founder and CEO of TTI, a Fort Worth-based subsidiary ofBerkshire. Throughout his life \u2013 in both his business andhis personal pursuits \u2013 Paul quietly displayed all the qualities that Charlie and I admire. His story should be told.In 1971, Paul was working as a purchasing agent for General Dynamics when the roof fell in. After losing ahuge defense contract, the company fired thousands of employees, including Paul.With his first child due soon, Paul decided to bet on himself, using $500 of his savings to found Tex-Tronics(later renamed TTI). The company set itself up to distribute small electronic components, and first-year sales totaled$112,000. Today, TTI markets more than one million different items with annual volume of $7.7 billion.But back to 2006: Paul, at 63, then found himself happy with his family, his job, and his associates. But hehad one nagging worry, heightened because he had recently witnessed a friend\u2019s early death and the disastrous resultsthat followed for that man\u2019s family and business. What, Paul asked himself in 2006, would happen to the many peopledepending onhimif he should unexpectedly die?For a year, Paul wrestled with his options. Sell to a competitor? From a strictly economic viewpoint, thatcourse made the most sense. After all, competitors could envision lucrative \u201csynergies\u201d \u2013 savings that would beachieved as the acquiror slashed duplicated functions at TTI.B u t...S u c hap u r c haser would most certainly also retain itsCFO,itslegal counsel,itsHR unit. Their TTI counterparts would therefore be sent packing. And ugh! If a new distribution center were to be needed, the acquirer\u2019shome city would certainly be favored over Fort Worth.\n9Whatever the financial benefits, Paul quickly concluded that selling to a competitor was not for him. He nextconsidered seeking a financial buyer, a species once labeled \u2013 aptly so \u2013 a leveraged buyout firm. Paul knew, however,that such a purchaser would be focused on an \u201cexit strategy.\u201d And who could know what that would be? Broodingover it all, Paul found himself having no interest in handing his 35-year-old creation over to a reseller.When Paul met me, he explained why he had eliminated these two alternatives as buyers. He then summedup his dilemma by saying \u2013 in far more tactful phrasing than this \u2013 \u201cAfter a year of pondering the alternatives, I wantto sell to Berkshire because you are the only guy left.\u201d So, I made an offer and Paul said \u201cYes.\u201d One meeting; onelunch; one deal.To say we both lived happily ever after is an understatement. When Berkshire purchased TTI, the companyemployed 2,387. Now the number is 8,043. A large percentage of that growth took place in Fort Worth and environs.Earnings have increased 673%.Annually, I would call Paul and tell him his salary should be substantially increased. Annually, he would tellme, \u201cWe can talk about that next year, Warren; I\u2019m too busy now.\u201dWhen Greg Abel and I attended Paul\u2019s memorial service, we met children, grandchildren, long-timeassociates (including TTI\u2019s first employee) and John Roach, the former CEO of a Fort Worth company Berkshire hadpurchased in 2000. John had steered his friend Paul to Omaha, instinctively knowing we would be a match.At the service, Greg and I heard about the multitudes of people and organizations that Paul had silentlysupported. The breadth of his generosity was extraordinary \u2013 geared always to improving the lives of others,particularly those in Fort Worth.In all ways, Paul was a class act. ************ Good luck \u2013 occasionallyextraordinaryluck \u2013 has played its part at Berkshire. If Paul and I had not enjoyed a mutual friend \u2013 John Roach \u2013 TTI would not have found its home with us. But that ample serving of luck was onlythe beginning. TTI was soon to lead Berkshire to its most important acquisition.Every fall, Berkshire directors gather for a presentation by a few of our executives. We sometimes choosethe site based upon the location of a recent acquisition, by that means allowing directors to meet the new subsidiary\u2019sCEO and learn more about the acquiree\u2019s activities.In the fall of 2009, we consequently selected Fort Worth so that we could visit TTI. At that time, BNSF,which also had Fort Worth as its hometown, was the third-largest holding among our marketable equities. Despite thatlarge stake, I had never visited the railroad\u2019s headquarters.\nDeb Bosanek, my assistant, scheduled our board\u2019s opening dinner for October 22. Meanwhile, I arranged toarrive earlier that day to meet with Matt Rose, CEO of BNSF, whose accomplishments I had long admired. When Imade the date, I had no idea that our get-together would coincide with BNSF\u2019s third-quarter earnings report, whichwas released late on the 22\nnd.\nThe market reacted badly to the railroad\u2019s results. The Great Recession was in full force in the third quarter,and BNSF\u2019s earnings reflected that slump. The economic outlook was also bleak, and Wall Street wasn\u2019t feelingfriendly to railroads \u2013 or much else.\n10On the following day, I again got together with Matt and suggested that Berkshire would offer the railroad abetter long-term home than it could expect as a public company. I also told him the maximum price that Berkshirewould pay.Matt relayed the offer to his directors and advisors. Eleven busy days later, Berkshire and BNSF announceda firm deal. And here I\u2019ll venture a rare prediction: BNSF will be a key asset for Berkshire andour country a century from now.\nThe BNSF acquisition would never have happened if Paul Andrews hadn\u2019t sized up Berkshire as the righthome for TTI.\nThanks\nI taught my first investing class 70 years ago. Since then, I have enjoyed working almost every year withstudents of all ages, finally \u201cretiring\u201d from that pursuit in 2018.\nAlong the way, my toughest audience was my grandson\u2019s fifth-grade class. The 11-year-olds were squirmingin their seats and giving me blank stares until I mentioned Coca-Cola and its famous secret formula. Instantly, everyhand went up, and I learned that \u201csecrets\u201d are catnip to kids.Teaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenonthe orangutan effect: If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, youmay leave behind a puzzled primate, but will yourself exit thinking more clearly.\nTalking to university students is far superior. I have urged that they seek employment in (1) the field and (2)with the kind of people they would select, if they had no needfor money. Economic realities, I acknowledge, may interfere with that kind of search. Even so, I urge the students never to give up the quest, for when they find that sortof job, they will no longer be \u201cworking.\u201d\nCharlie and I, ourselves, followed that liberating course after a few early stumbles. We both started as part-timers at my grandfather\u2019s grocery store, Charlie in 1940 and I in 1942. We were each assigned boring tasks and paidlittle, definitely not what we had in mind. Charlie later took up law, and I tried selling securities. Job satisfactioncontinued to elude us.Finally, at Berkshire, we found what we love to do. With very few exceptions, we have now \u201cworked\u201d formany decades with people whom we like and trust. It\u2019s a joy in life to join with managers such as Paul Andrews orthe Berkshire families I told you about last year. In our home office, we employ decent and talented people \u2013 no jerks.Turnover averages, perhaps, one person per year.Iw o u l dl i k e ,h o w e v e r ,t oe m p h a s i z eaf u r t h e ri t e mt h a tt u r n so u rj o b si n t of u na n ds a t i s f a c t i o n----w o r k i n gfor you. There is nothing more rewarding to Charlie and me than enjoying the trust of individuallong-term shareholders who, for many decades, have joined us with the expectation that we would be a reliable custodian of theirfunds.Obviously, we can\u2019t select our owners, as we could do if our formof operation were a partnership. Anyone can buy shares of Berkshire today with the intention of soon reselling them. For sure, we get a few of that type ofshareholder, just as we get index funds that own huge amounts of Berkshire simply because they are required to doso.\n11To a truly unusual degree, however, Berkshire has as owners a very large corps of individuals and familiesthat have elected to join us with an intent approaching \u201ctil death do us part.\u201d Often, they have trusted us with a large\u2013 some might sayexcessive\u2013 portion of their savings.Berkshire, these shareholders would sometimes acknowledge, might be far from the bestselection they could have made. But they would add that Berkshire would rank high among those with which they would be mostcomfortable. And people who are comfortable with their investments will, on average, achieve better results than thosewho are motivated by ever-changing headlines, chatter and promises.\nLong-term individual owners are both the \u201cpartners\u201d Charlie and I have always sought and the ones weconstantly have in mind as we make decisions at Berkshire. To them we say, \u201cIt feels good to \u2018work\u2019 for you, and youhave our thanks for your trust.\u201d\nThe Annual Meeting\nClear your calendar!

Munger, my long-time partner, and I have the job of managing the savings of a great number of individuals. We are grateful for their enduring trust, a relationship that often spans much of their adult lifetime. It is those dedicated savers that are forefront in my mind as I write this letter.\n\nA common belief is that people choose to save when young, expecting thereby to maintain their living standards after retirement. Any assets that remain at death, this theory says, will usually be left to their families or, possibly, to friends and philanthropy.\n\nOur experience has differed. We believe Berkshire\u2019s individual holders largely to be of the once-a-saver, always-a-saver variety. Though these people live well, they eventually dispense most of their funds to philanthropic organizations. These, in turn, redistribute the funds by expenditures intended to improve the lives of a great many people who are unrelated to the original benefactor. Sometimes, the results have been spectacular.\n\nThe disposition of money unmasks humans. Charlie and I watch with pleasure the vast flow of Berkshire-generated funds to public needs and, alongside, the infrequency with which our shareholders opt for look-at-me assets and dynasty-building.\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t enjoy working for shareholders like ours?\n\nWhat We Do\n\nCharlie and I allocate your savings at Berkshire between two related forms of ownership. First, we invest in businesses that we control, usually buying 100% of each. Berkshire directs capital allocation at these subsidiaries and selects the CEOs who make day-by-day operating decisions. When large enterprises are being managed, both trust and rules are essential. Berkshire emphasizes the former to an unusual \u2013 some would say extreme \u2013 degree. Disappointments are inevitable. We are understanding about business mistakes; our tolerance for personal misconduct is zero.\n\nIn our second category of ownership, we buy publicly-traded stocks through which we passively own pieces of businesses. Holding these investments, we have no say in management.\n \nOur goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with both long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers. Please note particularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-term business performance, not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales. That point is crucial: Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers.\n\nOver the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many that enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way, other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public. Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrently delivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon \u201ccreative destruction.\u201d\n\nOne advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that \u2013 episodically \u2013 it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It\u2019s crucial to understand that stocks often trade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. \u201cEfficient\u201d markets exist only in textbooks. In truth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only in retrospect.\n\nControlled businesses are a different breed. They sometimes command ridiculously higher prices than justified but are almost never available at bargain valuations. Unless under duress, the owner of a controlled business gives no thought to selling at a panic-type valuation.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nAt this point, a report card from me is appropriate: In 58 years of Berkshire management, most of my capital-allocation decisions have been no better than so-so. In some cases, also, bad moves by me have been rescued by very large doses of luck. (Remember our escapes from near-disasters at USAir and Salomon? I certainly do.)\n\nOur satisfactory results have been the product of about a dozen truly good decisions \u2013 that would be about one every five years \u2013 and a sometimes-forgotten advantage that favors long-term investors such as Berkshire. Let\u2019s take a peek behind the curtain.\n\nThe Secret Sauce\n\nIn August 1994 \u2013 yes, 1994 \u2013 Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion \u2013 then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire.\n\nThe cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke\u2019s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow.\n \nAmerican Express is much the same story. Berkshire\u2019s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase.\n\nThese dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire\u2019s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago.\n\nAssume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a high-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 0.3% of Berkshire\u2019s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of annual income.\n\nThe lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.\n\nThe Past Year in Brief\n\nBerkshire had a good year in 2022. The company\u2019s operating earnings \u2013 our term for income calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), exclusive of capital gains or losses from equity holdings \u2013 set a record at $30.8 billion. Charlie and I focus on this operational figure and urge you to do so as well. The GAAP figure, absent our adjustment, fluctuates wildly and capriciously at every reporting date. Note its acrobatic behavior in 2022, which is in no way unusual:\n\n\tEarnings in $ billions\t\nGAAP Earnings We\n2022 Quarter\t\u201cOperating Earnings\u201d\tare Required to Report\n1\t7.0\t5.5\n2\t9.3\t(43.8)\n3\t7.8\t(2.7)\n4\t6.7\t18.2\nThe GAAP earnings are 100% misleading when viewed quarterly or even annually. Capital gains, to be sure, have been hugely important to Berkshire over past decades, and we expect them to be meaningfully positive in future decades. But their quarter-by-quarter gyrations, regularly and mindlessly headlined by media, totally misinform investors.\n \nA second positive development for Berkshire last year was our purchase of Alleghany Corporation, a property-casualty insurer captained by Joe Brandon. I\u2019ve worked with Joe in the past, and he understands both Berkshire and insurance. Alleghany delivers special value to us because Berkshire\u2019s unmatched financial strength allows its insurance subsidiaries to follow valuable and enduring investment strategies unavailable to virtually all competitors.\n\nAided by Alleghany, our insurance float increased during 2022 from $147 billion to $164 billion. With disciplined underwriting, these funds have a decent chance of being cost-free over time. Since purchasing our first property-casualty insurer in 1967, Berkshire\u2019s float has increased 8,000-fold through acquisitions, operations and innovations. Though not recognized in our financial statements, this float has been an extraordinary asset for Berkshire. New shareholders can get an understanding of its value by reading our annually updated explanation of float on page A-2.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nA very minor gain in per-share intrinsic value took place in 2022 through Berkshire share repurchases as well as similar moves at Apple and American Express, both significant investees of ours. At Berkshire, we directly increased your interest in our unique collection of businesses by repurchasing 1.2% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. At Apple and Amex, repurchases increased Berkshire\u2019s ownership a bit without any cost to us.\n\nThe math isn\u2019t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices. Just as surely, when a company overpays for repurchases, the continuing shareholders lose. At such times, gains flow only to the selling shareholders and to the friendly, but expensive, investment banker who recommended the foolish purchases.\n\nGains from value-accretive repurchases, it should be emphasized, benefit all owners \u2013 in every respect. Imagine, if you will, three fully-informed shareholders of a local auto dealership, one of whom manages the business. Imagine, further, that one of the passive owners wishes to sell his interest back to the company at a price attractive to the two continuing shareholders. When completed, has this transaction harmed anyone? Is the manager somehow favored over the continuing passive owners? Has the public been hurt?\n\nWhen you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).\n \nAlmost endless details of Berkshire\u2019s 2022 operations are laid out on pages K-33 \u2013 K-66. Charlie and I, along with many Berkshire shareholders, enjoy poring over the many facts and figures laid out in that section. These pages are not, however, required reading. There are many Berkshire centimillionaires and, yes, billionaires who have never studied our financial figures. They simply know that Charlie and I \u2013 along with our families and close friends \u2013 continue to have very significant investments in Berkshire, and they trust us to treat their money as we do our own.\n\nAnd that is a promise we can make.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nFinally, an important warning: Even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily be manipulated by managers who wish to do so. Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticated by CEOs, directors and their advisors. Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well. Beating \u201cexpectations\u201d is heralded as a managerial triumph.\n\nThat activity is disgusting. It requires no talent to manipulate numbers: Only a deep desire to deceive is required. \u201cBold imaginative accounting,\u201d as a CEO once described his deception to me, has become one of the shames of capitalism.\n\n58 Years \u2013 and a Few Figures\n\nIn 1965, Berkshire was a one-trick pony, the owner of a venerable \u2013 but doomed \u2013 New England textile operation. With that business on a death march, Berkshire needed an immediate fresh start. Looking back, I was slow to recognize the severity of its problems.\n\nAnd then came a stroke of good luck: National Indemnity became available in 1967, and we shifted our resources toward insurance and other non-textile operations.\n\nThus began our journey to 2023, a bumpy road involving a combination of continuous savings by our owners (that is, by their retaining earnings), the power of compounding, our avoidance of major mistakes and \u2013 most important of all \u2013 the American Tailwind. America would have done fine without Berkshire. The reverse is not true.\n\nBerkshire now enjoys major ownership in an unmatched collection of huge and diversified businesses. Let\u2019s first look at the 5,000 or so publicly-held companies that trade daily on NASDAQ, the NYSE and related venues. Within this group is housed the members of the S&P 500 Index, an elite collection of large and well-known American companies.\n\nIn aggregate, the 500 earned $1.8 trillion in 2021. I don\u2019t yet have the final results for 2022. Using, therefore, the 2021 figures, only 128 of the 500 (including Berkshire itself) earned $3 billion or more. Indeed, 23 lost money.\n \nAt yearend 2022, Berkshire was the largest owner of eight of these giants: American Express, Bank of America, Chevron, Coca-Cola, HP Inc., Moody\u2019s, Occidental Petroleum and Paramount Global.\n\nIn addition to those eight investees, Berkshire owns 100% of BNSF and 92% of BH Energy, each with earnings that exceed the $3 billion mark noted above ($5.9 billion at BNSF and\n$4.3 billion at BHE). Were these companies publicly-owned, they would replace two present members of the 500. All told, our ten controlled and non-controlled behemoths leave Berkshire more broadly aligned with the country\u2019s economic future than is the case at any other U.S. company. (This calculation leaves aside \u201cfiduciary\u201d operations such as pension funds and investment companies.) In addition, Berkshire\u2019s insurance operation, though conducted through many individually-managed subsidiaries, has a value comparable to BNSF or BHE.\n\nAs for the future, Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and U.S. Treasury bills along with a wide array of businesses. We will also avoid behavior that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses. Our CEO will always be the Chief Risk Officer \u2013 a task it is irresponsible to delegate. Additionally, our future CEOs will have a significant part of their net worth in Berkshire shares, bought with their own money. And yes, our shareholders will continue to save and prosper by retaining earnings.\n\nAt Berkshire, there will be no finish line.\n\nSome Surprising Facts About Federal Taxes\n\nDuring the decade ending in 2021, the United States Treasury received about $32.3 trillion in taxes while it spent $43.9 trillion.\n\nThough economists, politicians and many of the public have opinions about the consequences of that huge imbalance, Charlie and I plead ignorance and firmly believe that near-term economic and market forecasts are worse than useless. Our job is to manage Berkshire\u2019s operations and finances in a manner that will achieve an acceptable result over time and that will preserve the company\u2019s unmatched staying power when financial panics or severe worldwide recessions occur. Berkshire also offers some modest protection from runaway inflation, but this attribute is far from perfect. Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences.\n\nThe $32 trillion of revenue was garnered by the Treasury through individual income taxes (48%), social security and related receipts (341\uf0a42%), corporate income tax payments (81\uf0a42%) and a wide variety of lesser levies. Berkshire\u2019s contribution via the corporate income tax was $32 billion during the decade, almost exactly a tenth of 1% of all money that the Treasury collected.\n \nAnd that means \u2013 brace yourself \u2013 had there been roughly 1,000 taxpayers in the U.S. matching Berkshire\u2019s payments, no other businesses nor any of the country\u2019s 131 million households would have needed to pay any taxes to the federal government. Not a dime.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nMillions, billions, trillions \u2013 we all know the words, but the sums involved are almost impossible to comprehend. Let\u2019s put physical dimensions to the numbers:\n\n\u2022\tIf you convert $1 million into newly-printed $100 bills, you will have a stack that reaches your chest.\n\u2022\tPerform the same exercise with $1 billion \u2013 this is getting exciting! \u2013 and the stack reaches about 3\uf0a44 of a mile into the sky.\n\u2022\tFinally, imagine piling up $32 billion, the total of Berkshire\u2019s 2012-21 federal income tax payments. Now the stack grows to more than 21 miles in height, about three times the level at which commercial airplanes usually cruise.\n\nWhen it comes to federal taxes, individuals who own Berkshire can unequivocally state \u201cI gave at the office.\u201d\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nAt Berkshire we hope and expect to pay much more in taxes during the next decade. We owe the country no less: America\u2019s dynamism has made a huge contribution to whatever success Berkshire has achieved \u2013 a contribution Berkshire will always need. We count on the American Tailwind and, though it has been becalmed from time to time, its propelling force has always returned.\n\nI have been investing for 80 years \u2013 more than one-third of our country\u2019s lifetime. Despite our citizens\u2019 penchant \u2013 almost enthusiasm \u2013 for self-criticism and self-doubt, I have yet to see a time when it made sense to make a long-term bet against America. And I doubt very much that any reader of this letter will have a different experience in the future.\n\nNothing Beats Having a Great Partner\n\nCharlie and I think pretty much alike. But what it takes me a page to explain, he sums up in a sentence. His version, moreover, is always more clearly reasoned and also more artfully \u2013 some might add bluntly \u2013 stated.\n\nHere are a few of his thoughts, many lifted from a very recent podcast:\n\n\u2022\tThe world is full of foolish gamblers, and they will not do as well as the patient investor.\n\u2022\tIf you don\u2019t see the world the way it is, it\u2019s like judging something through a distorted lens.\n\u2022\tAll I want to know is where I\u2019m going to die, so I\u2019ll never go there. And a related thought: Early on, write your desired obituary \u2013 and then behave accordingly.\n\u2022\tIf you don\u2019t care whether you are rational or not, you won\u2019t work on it. Then you will stay irrational and get lousy results.\n \n\u2022\tPatience can be learned. Having a long attention span and the ability to concentrate on one thing for a long time is a huge advantage.\n\u2022\tYou can learn a lot from dead people. Read of the deceased you admire and detest.\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t bail away in a sinking boat if you can swim to one that is seaworthy.\n\u2022\tA great company keeps working after you are not; a mediocre company won\u2019t do that.\n\u2022\tWarren and I don\u2019t focus on the froth of the market. We seek out good long-term investments and stubbornly hold them for a long time.\n\u2022\tBen Graham said, \u201cDay to day, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term it\u2019s a weighing machine.\u201d If you keep making something more valuable, then some wise person is going to notice it and start buying.\n\u2022\tThere is no such thing as a 100% sure thing when investing. Thus, the use of leverage is dangerous. A string of wonderful numbers times zero will always equal zero. Don\u2019t count on getting rich twice.\n\u2022\tYou don\u2019t, however, need to own a lot of things in order to get rich.\n\u2022\tYou have to keep learning if you want to become a great investor. When the world changes,\nyou must change.\n\u2022\tWarren and I hated railroad stocks for decades, but the world changed and finally the country had four huge railroads of vital importance to the American economy. We were slow to recognize the change, but better late than never.\n\u2022\tFinally, I will add two short sentences by Charlie that have been his decision-clinchers for decades: \u201cWarren, think more about it. You\u2019re smart and I\u2019m right.\u201d\n\nAnd so it goes. I never have a phone call with Charlie without learning something. And, while he makes me think, he also makes me laugh.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nI will add to Charlie\u2019s list a rule of my own: Find a very smart high-grade partner \u2013 preferably slightly older than you \u2013 and then listen very carefully to what he says.\n\nA Family Gathering in Omaha\nCharlie and I are shameless. Last year, at our first shareholder get-together in three years, we greeted you with our usual commercial hustle.\n\nFrom the opening bell, we went straight for your wallet. In short order, our See\u2019s kiosk sold you eleven tons of nourishing peanut brittle and chocolates. In our P.T. Barnum pitch, we promised you longevity. After all, what else but candy from See\u2019s could account for Charlie and me making it to 99 and 92?\n\nI know you can\u2019t wait to hear the specifics of last year\u2019s hustle.\n\nOn Friday, the doors were open from noon until 5 p.m., and our candy counters rang up 2,690 individual sales. On Saturday, See\u2019s registered an additional 3,931 transactions between 7 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., despite the fact that 61\uf0a42 of the 91\uf0a42 operating hours occurred while our movie and the question-and-answer session were limiting commercial traffic.\n \nDo the math: See\u2019s rang up about 10 sales per minute during its prime operating time (racking up $400,309 of volume during the two days), with all the goods purchased at a single location selling products that haven\u2019t been materially altered in 101 years. What worked for See\u2019s in the days of Henry Ford\u2019s model T works now.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * \nCharlie, I, and the entire Berkshire bunch look forward to seeing you in Omaha on May 5-6. We will have a good time and so will you.\n\n\nFebruary 25, 2023\tWarren E.

Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold atmarket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire\u2019sresults through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculatedusing the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter- tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, itsresults would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded theS&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused theaggregate lag to be substantial.\n2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2013 was $34.2 billion. That gain was afterour deducting $1.8 billion of charges \u2013 meaningless economically, as I will explain later \u2013 that arose from our purchase of the minorityinterests in Marmon and Iscar. After those charges, the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stockincreased by 18.2%. Over the last 49 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grownfrom $19 to $134,973, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*On the facing page, we show our long-standing performance measurement: The yearly change inBerkshire\u2019s per-share book value versus the market performance of the S&P 500. What counts, of course, is per-shareintrinsicvalue. But that\u2019s a subjective figure, and book value is useful as a rough tracking indicator. (Anextended discussion of intrinsic value is included in our Owner-Related Business Principles on pages 103 - 108.Those principles have been included in our reports for 30 years, and we urge new and prospective shareholders toread them.)As I\u2019ve long told you, Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value. Moreover, the difference haswidened considerably in recent years. That\u2019s why our 2012 decision to authorize the repurchase of shares at 120%of book value made sense. Purchases at that level benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic valueexceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount. We did not purchase shares during 2013, however,because the stock price did not descend to the 120% level. If it does, we will be aggressive.Charlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman and my partner, and I believe both Berkshire\u2019s book value andintrinsic value will outperform the S&P in years when the market is down or moderately up. We expect to fallshort, though, in years when the market is strong \u2013 as we did in 2013. We have underperformed in ten of our 49years, with all but one of our shortfalls occurring when the S&P gain exceeded 15%.Over the stock market cycle between yearends 2007 and 2013, we overperformed the S&P. Through fullcycles in future years, we expect to do that again. If we fail to do so, we will not have earned our pay. After all, youcould always own an index fund and be assured of S&P results.The Year at BerkshireOn the operating front, just about everything turned out well for us last year \u2013 in certain cases verywell. Let me count the ways:\n\u0160We completed two large acquisitions, spending almost $18 billion to purchase all of NV Energy and amajor interest in H. J. Heinz. Both companies fit us well and will be prospering a century from now.With the Heinz purchase, moreover, we created a partnership template that may be used by Berkshire infuture acquisitions of size. Here, we teamed up with investors at 3G Capital, a firm led by my friend, JorgePaulo Lemann. His talented associates \u2013 Bernardo Hees, Heinz\u2019s new CEO, and Alex Behring, itsChairman \u2013 are responsible for operations.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are1/1500\nthof those shown for A.3Berkshire is the financing partner. In that role, we purchased $8 billion of Heinz preferred stock thatcarries a 9% coupon but also possesses other features that should increase the preferred\u2019s annual return to12% or so. Berkshire and 3G each purchased half of the Heinz common stock for $4.25 billion.Though the Heinz acquisition has some similarities to a \u201cprivate equity\u201d transaction, there is a crucialdifference: Berkshire never intends to sell a share of the company. What we would like, rather, is to buymore, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, andwe might increase our ownership at such times. Berkshire and 3G could also decide at some point that itwould be mutually beneficial if we were to exchange some of our preferred for common shares (at anequity valuation appropriate to the time).Our partnership took control of Heinz in June, and operating results so far are encouraging. Only minorearnings from Heinz, however, are reflected in those we report for Berkshire this year: One-time chargesincurred in the purchase and subsequent restructuring of operations totaled $1.3 billion. Earnings in 2014will be substantial.With Heinz, Berkshire now owns 8\n1\u20442companies that, were they stand-alone businesses, would be in theFortune 500. Only 491\n1\u20442to go.NV Energy, purchased for $5.6 billion by MidAmerican Energy, our utility subsidiary, supplies electricityto about 88% of Nevada\u2019s population. This acquisition fits nicely into our existing electric-utilityoperation and offers many possibilities for large investments in renewable energy. NV Energy will notbe MidAmerican\u2019s last major acquisition.\n\u0160MidAmerican is one of our \u201cPowerhouse Five\u201d \u2013 a collection of large non-insurance businesses that, inaggregate, had a record $10.8 billion of pre-tax earnings in 2013, up $758 million from 2012. The othercompanies in this sainted group are BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol and Marmon.Of the five, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire nine yearsago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and, for the remainder, issued shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $10.4 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the nine-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfiesour goal of not simply growing, but rather increasing per-shareresults. If the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2014, we can expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five toimprove also \u2013 perhaps by $1 billion or so pre-tax.\n\u0160Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $4.7 billion pre-tax last year, up from $3.9billion in 2012. Here, too, we expect further gains in 2014.\n\u0160Berkshire\u2019s extensive insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2013 \u2013 that makes 11years in a row \u2013 and increased its float. During that 11-year stretch, our float \u2013 money that doesn\u2019t belongto us but that we can invest for Berkshire\u2019s benefit \u2013 has grown from $41 billion to $77 billion.Concurrently, our underwriting profit has aggregated $22 billion pre-tax, including $3 billion realized in2013. And all of this all began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million. We now own a wide variety of exceptional insurance operations. Best known is GEICO, the car insurerBerkshire acquired in full at yearend 1995 (having for many years prior owned a partial interest). GEICOin 1996 ranked number seven among U.S. auto insurers. Now, GEICO is number two, having recentlypassed Allstate. The reasons for this amazing growth are simple: low prices and reliable service. You cando yourself a favor by calling 1-800-847-7536 or checking Geico.com to see if you, too, can cut yourinsurance costs. Buy some of Berkshire\u2019s other products with the savings.4\u0160While Charlie and I search for elephants, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on acquisitions.Last year, we contracted for 25 of these, scheduled to cost $3.1 billion in aggregate. These transactionsranged from $1.9 million to $1.1 billion in size.Charlie and I encourage these deals. They deploy capital in activities that fit with our existing businessesand that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. The result is no more work for us and moreearnings for you. Many more of these bolt-on deals will be made in future years. In aggregate, they will bemeaningful.\n\u0160Last year we invested $3.5 billion in the surest sort of bolt-on: the purchase of additional shares in twowonderful businesses that we already controlled. In one case \u2013 Marmon \u2013 our purchases brought us to the100% ownership we had signed up for in 2008. In the other instance \u2013 Iscar \u2013 the Wertheimer familyelected to exercise a put option it held, selling us the 20% of the business it retained when we boughtcontrol in 2006.These purchases added about $300 million pre-tax to our current earning power and also delivered us $800million of cash. Meanwhile, the same nonsensical accounting rule that I described in last year\u2019s letterrequired that we enter these purchases on our books at $1.8 billion less than we paid, a process thatreduced Berkshire\u2019s book value. (The charge was made to \u201ccapital in excess of par value\u201d; figure thatone out.) This weird accounting, you should understand, instantly increased Berkshire\u2019s excess of intrinsicvalue over book value by the same $1.8 billion.\n\u0160Our subsidiaries spent a record $11 billion on plant and equipment during 2013, roughly twice ourdepreciation charge. About 89% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we invest abroad aswell, the mother lode of opportunity resides in America.\n\u0160In a year in which most equity managers found it impossible to outperform the S&P 500, both ToddCombs and Ted Weschler handily did so. Each now runs a portfolio exceeding $7 billion. They\u2019ve earnedit.I must again confess that their investments outperformed mine. (Charlie says I should add \u201cby a lot.\u201d) Ifsuch humiliating comparisons continue, I\u2019ll have no choice but to cease talking about them.Todd and Ted have also created significant value for you in several matters unrelated to their portfolioactivities. Their contributions are just beginning: Both men have Berkshire blood in their veins.\n\u0160Berkshire\u2019s yearend employment \u2013 counting Heinz \u2013 totaled a record 330,745, up 42,283 from last year.The increase, I must admit, included one person at our Omaha home office. (Don\u2019t panic: Theheadquarters gang still fits comfortably on one floor.)\n\u0160Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its \u201cBig Four\u201d investments \u2013 AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of Wells Fargo (increasingour ownership to 9.2% versus 8.7% at yearend 2012) and IBM (6.3% versus 6.0%). Meanwhile, stockrepurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.9% to 9.1% and our interest in American Express from 13.7% to 14.2%. And, if youthink tenths of a percent aren\u2019t important, ponder this math: For the four companies in aggregate, eachincrease of one-tenth of a percent in our share of their equity raises Berkshire\u2019s share of their annualearnings by $50 million.\n5The four companies possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented andshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business; it\u2019s better to have a partial interest in the Hopediamond than to own all of a rhinestone.Going by our yearend holdings, our portion of the \u201cBig Four\u2019s\u201d 2013 earnings amounted to $4.4 billion. Inthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \u2013 about $1.4 billion lastyear. But make no mistake: The $3 billion of their earnings we don\u2019t report is every bit as valuable to us asthe portion Berkshire records.The earnings that these four companies retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock \u2013 a movethat enhances our share of future earnings \u2013 as well as for funding business opportunities that usually turnout to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees willgrow substantially over time. If they do, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important,our unrealized capital gains will, too. (For the four, unrealized gains already totaled $39 billion atyearend.)Our flexibility in capital allocation \u2013 our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlledbusinesses \u2013 gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they canoperate. Woody Allen stated the general idea when he said: \u201cThe advantage of being bi-sexual is that itdoubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.\u201d Similarly, our appetite for eitheroperating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for our endless gusher of cash.************Late in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase inBerkshire\u2019s history. At the time, I called the transaction an \u201call-in wager on the economic future of the UnitedStates.\u201dThat kind of commitment was nothing new for us: We\u2019ve been making similar wagers ever since BuffettPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too. Charlie and I have always considereda \u201cbet\u201d on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.Indeed, who has ever benefited during the past 237 years by betting againstAmerica? If you compare our country\u2019s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. And the dynamismembedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. America\u2019s best days lie ahead.With this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic value by(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earningsthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shareswhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional largeacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.Those building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energywill still be playing major roles in our economy. Insurance will concomitantly be essential for both businesses andindividuals \u2013 and no company brings greater human and financial resources to that business than Berkshire.Moreover, we willalwaysmaintain supreme financial strength, operating with at least $20 billion of cashequivalents and never incurring material amounts of short-term obligations. As we view these and other strengths,Charlie and I like your company\u2019s prospects. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.\n6Intrinsic Business ValueAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what thatnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid outthe three elements \u2013 one of them qualitative \u2013 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\u2019sintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 109 - 110.Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2013 our per-share investments increased 13.6% to$129,253 and our pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 12.8% to $9,116per share.Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.3% compounded annually, and ourearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the 43-yearperiod has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains inboth sectors, but we will most strongly focus on building operating earnings.************Now, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet andincome characteristics from the others. So we\u2019ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important andenduringadvantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being thereporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don\u2019t get any ideas!)Insurance\u201cOur investment in the insurance companies reflects a first major step in our efforts to achieve a morediversified base of earning power.\u201d\u2014 1967 Annual ReportLet\u2019s look first at insurance, Berkshire\u2019s core operation and the engine that has consistently propelled ourexpansion since that 1967 report was published.Property-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, suchas those arising from certain workers\u2019 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go toothers. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims comeand go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume.Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And howwe have grown, as the following table shows:Year\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322013 77,240Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO\u2019s float will almost certainly grow.In National Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float driftsdownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be verygradual \u2013 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can neverbe subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. (In this respect, property-casualty insurancediffers in an important way from certain forms of life insurance.)7If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profitthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of freemoney \u2013 and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it.Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorousin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country\u2019s largest insurer and awell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in nine of the twelve years ending in 2012 (the latestyear for which their financials are available, as I write this). Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry \u2013 despite the float income all companies enjoy \u2013 will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns as compared to other businesses.As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for elevenconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $22 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we willcontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers who know that while float is valuable, it can be drowned by poor underwriting results.So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s bookvalue is calculated, thefullamount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think offloat as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims \u2013some $17 billion to more than five million claimants in 2013 \u2013 and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each daywrite new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float. If our revolving float is both costless andlong-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramaticallyless than the accounting liability.A counterpart to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \u201cgoodwill\u201d that is attributable to our insurancecompanies and included in book value as an asset. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid forthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwillasset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of ourinsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation possessing float of similar qualityto that we have \u2013 to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason \u2013 ahuge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.************Berkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers runningdisciplined operations that possess strong, hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risksthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are farmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record asignificant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. And we would remain awash in cash,looking for large opportunities if the catastrophe caused markets to go into shock. All other major insurers andreinsurers would meanwhile be far in the red, with some facing insolvency.From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $37 billion and a largecumulative underwriting profit, a feat no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. Ajit\u2019s mind is an ideafactory that is always looking for more lines of business he can add to his current assortment.8One venture materialized last June when he formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBHSI\u201d).This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantly accepted by both major insurancebrokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. These professionals recognize that no other insurer canmatch the financial strength of Berkshire, which guarantees that legitimate claims arising many years in the futurewill be paid promptly and fully.BHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insuranceworld. Peter has assembled a spectacular team that is already writing a substantial amount of business with manyFortune 500 companies and with smaller operations as well. BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that willgenerate volume in the billions within a few years. Give Peter a Berkshire greeting when you see him at the annualmeeting.************We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit afterboth prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can\u2019t be obtained.Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back on businessthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\u201dspells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s hugefloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We areparticularly enthusiastic about General Re\u2019s international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistentlyand profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, the company was beset by problems thatcaused commentators \u2013 and me as well, briefly \u2013 to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone.General Re is now a gem.************Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 63 years ago. GEICO is managed by TonyNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 52 years of service in 2013. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying.\nWhen I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage thecompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. That operational efficiency continuestoday and is an all-important asset. No onelikesto buy auto insurance. But almost everyone likes to drive. The insurance needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \u2013 and onlya low-cost operation can deliver these.\nGEICO\u2019s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year afteryear. Its low costs create a moat \u2013 anenduringone \u2013 that competitors are unable to cross. Meanwhile, our little gecko continues to tell Americans how GEICO can save them important money. With our latest reduction inoperating costs, his story has become even more compelling.\n9In 1995, we purchased the half of GEICO that we didn\u2019t already own, paying $1.4 billion more than the nettangible assets we acquired. That\u2019s \u201cgoodwill,\u201d and it will forever remain unchanged on our books. As GEICO\u2019sbusiness grows, however, so does itstrueeconomic goodwill. I believe that figure to be approaching $20 billion.\n************In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of themplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit. Moreover, as the table below shows, they also provide us withsubstantial float. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers. Underwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions) Insurance Operations\n2013 2012 2013 2012\nBH Reinsurance..............$1,294 $ 304 $37,231 $34,821General Re.................. 2 8 3 3 5 5 20,013 20,128 GEICO.....................1,127 680 12,566 11,578Other Primary................ 3 8 5 2 8 6 7,430 6,598\n$3,089 $1,625 $77,240 $73,125\n************Simply put, insurance is the sale of promises. The \u201ccustomer\u201d pays money now; the insurer promises topay money in the future if certain events occur.Sometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by those in their20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay \u2013 even if economic chaos prevails whenpayment time arrives \u2013 is all-important.Berkshire\u2019s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by the actions of the world\u2019s largestand most sophisticated insurers, some of which have wanted to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities, particularly those involving asbestos claims. That is, these insurers wished to \u201ccede\u201d their liabilitiesto a reinsurer. Choosing the wrong reinsurer, however \u2013 one that down the road proved to be financially strapped ora bad actor \u2013 would put the original insurer in danger of getting the liabilities right back in its lap.Almost without exception, the largest insurers seeking aid came to Berkshire. Indeed, in the largest suchtransaction ever recorded, Lloyd\u2019s in 2007 turned over to us both many thousands of known claims arising frompolicies written before 1993 and an unknown but huge number of claims from that same period sure to materializein the future. (Yes, we will be receiving claims decades from now that apply to events taking place prior to 1993.)Berkshire\u2019s ultimate payments arising from the Lloyd\u2019s transaction are today unknowable. What is certain,however, is that Berkshire will pay all valid claims up to the $15 billion limit of our policy. No other insurer\u2019spromise would have given Lloyd\u2019s the comfort provided by its agreement with Berkshire. The CEO of the entitythen handling Lloyd\u2019s claims said it best: \u201cNames [the original insurers at Lloyd\u2019s] wanted to sleep easy at night,and we think we\u2019ve just bought them the world\u2019s best mattress.\u201d************Berkshire\u2019s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models possessing widemoats form something unique in the insurance world. The combination is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholdersthat will only get more valuable with time.\n10Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\u201cThough there are many regulatory restraints in the utility industry, it\u2019s possible that we will makeadditional commitments in the field. If we do, the amounts involved could be large.\u201d\u2014 1999 Annual ReportWe have two major operations, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that share important characteristicsdistinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter andsplit out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, withthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF\u2019s interest coverage was 9:1. (Our definition of coverage ispre-tax earnings/interest,notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\u2019s ability to service its debt under allcircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companiesexclusively offering an essential service. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earningsstreams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Now, with the acquisition ofNV Energy, MidAmerican\u2019s earnings base has further broadened. This particular strength, supplemented byBerkshire\u2019s ownership, has enabled MidAmerican and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost ofdebt. This advantage benefits both usandour customers.Every day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\n\u0160BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by truck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyoneelse, a fact establishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy\u2019s circulatory system. Its hold on thenumber-one position strengthened in 2013.BNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentallyfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking onthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\n\u0160MidAmerican\u2019s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretchesfurther. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: From a standing start nine years ago, MidAmericannow accounts for 7% of the country\u2019s wind generation capacity, with more on the way. Our share insolar \u2013 most of which is still in construction \u2013 is even larger.MidAmerican can make these investments because it retains allof its earnings. Here\u2019s a little known fact: Last year MidAmerican retained more dollars of earnings \u2013 by far \u2013 than any other American electricutility. We and our regulators see this as an important advantage \u2013 one almost certain to exist five, ten andtwenty years from now.When our current projects are completed, MidAmerican\u2019s renewables portfolio will have cost $15 billion.We relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns. And, on that front, we put a largeamount of trust in future regulation.\n11Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will foreverneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is meanwhile in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.Tangible proof of our dedication to that duty was delivered last year in a poll of customer satisfactioncovering 52 holding companies and their 101 operating electric utilities. Our MidAmerican group ranked numberone, with 95.3% of respondents giving us a \u201cvery satisfied\u201d vote and not a single customer rating us \u201cdissatisfied.\u201dThe bottom score in the survey, incidentally, was a dismal 34.5%.All three of our companies were ranked far lower by this measure before they were acquired byMidAmerican. The extraordinary customer satisfaction we have achieved is of great importance as we expand:Regulators in states we hope to enter are glad to see us, knowing we will be responsible operators.Our railroad has been diligent as well in anticipating the needs of its customers. Whatever you may haveheard about our country\u2019s crumbling infrastructure in no way applies to BNSF or railroads generally. America\u2019s railsystem has never been in better shape, a consequence of huge investments by the industry. We are not, however,resting: BNSF spent $4 billion on the railroad in 2013, double its depreciation charge and a single-year record foranyrailroad. And, we will spend considerably more in 2014. Like Noah, who foresaw early on the need fordependable transportation, we know it\u2019s our job to plan ahead.Leading our two capital-intensive companies are Greg Abel, at MidAmerican, and the team of Matt Roseand Carl Ice at BNSF.

Let\u2019s look, though, at a summary balancesheet and earnings statement for the entire group.Balance Sheet 12/31/13 (in millions)\nAssets Liabilities and Equity\nCash and equivalents................... $6,625 Notes payable.................... $1,615 Accounts and notes receivable............7,749 Other current liabilities.............8,965\nInventory.............................9,945 Total current liabilities.............10,580 Other current assets..................... 7 1 6\nTotal current assets.....................25,035Deferred taxes....................5,184 Goodwill and other intangibles............25,617 Term debt and other liabilities.......4,405 Fixed assets...........................19,389 Non-controlling interests............ 4 5 6 Other assets...........................4,274 Berkshire equity..................53,690\n$74,315 $74,315\nEarnings Statement (in millions)\n2013 2012 2011\nRevenues........................................................ $95,291 $83,255 $72,406 Operating expenses................................................ 88,414 76,978 67,239 Interest expense................................................... 1 3 5 1 4 6 1 3 0\nPre-tax earnings................................................... 6,742 6,131 5,037 Income taxes and non-controlling interests..............................2,512 2,432 1,998\nNet earnings...................................................... $ 4,230 $ 3,699 $ 3,039\nOur income and expense data conforming to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) is onpage 29. In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accountingitems (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlieand I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businessesaggregated in the table than do GAAP figures.\n13I won\u2019t explain all of the adjustments \u2013 some are tiny and arcane \u2013 but serious investors should understandthe disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others in no way lose value. Withsoftware, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as theamortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not realcosts. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenseswhen earnings are calculated \u2013 even though from an investor\u2019s viewpoint they could not be more different.In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $648 million for thecompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \u201creal,\u201d the rest not.This difference has become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. It will almost certainly risefurther as we acquire more companies.Eventually, of course, the non-real charges disappear when the assets to which they\u2019re related becomefully amortized. But this usually takes 15 years and \u2013 alas \u2013 it will be my successor whose reported earnings get thebenefit of their expiration.Every dime of depreciation expense we report, however, is a real cost. And that\u2019s true at almost all othercompanies as well. When Wall Streeters tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, button your wallet.Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality,however, remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.************The crowd of companies in this section sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some ofthese businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangibleassets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.A few, however, have very poor returns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation. Iwas not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry inwhich it operated.Fortunately, my blunders usually involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generallyworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, however, made my last mistake in purchasingeither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed anaverage of $25 billion of net tangible assets during 2013 and, with large quantities of excess cash and littleleverage, earned 16.7% after-tax on that capital.Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the purchase price is excessive.We have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in thelarge figure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we havedeployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carryingvalue by a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance andregulated-industry segments isfargreater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.************We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, both currentand potential competitors read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if they knew ournumbers. So, in some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, we onlydisclose what is required. You can find a good bit of detail about many of our operations, however, on pages 80-84.\n14I can\u2019t resist, however, giving you an update on Nebraska Furniture Mart\u2019s expansion into Texas. I\u2019m notcovering this event because of itseconomicimportance to Berkshire \u2013 it takes more than a new store to move theneedle on Berkshire\u2019s $225 billion equity base. But I\u2019ve now worked 30 years with the marvelous Blumkin family,and I\u2019m excited about the remarkable store \u2013 truly Texas-sized \u2013 it is building at The Colony, in the northern part ofthe Dallas metropolitan area.When the store is completed next year, NFM will have \u2013 under one roof, and on a 433-acre site \u2013 1.8 millionsquare feet of retail and supporting warehouse space. View the project\u2019s progress at www.nfm.com/texas. NFMalready owns the two highest-volume home furnishings stores in the country (in Omaha and Kansas City, Kansas),each doing about $450 million annually. I predict the Texas store will blow these records away. If you live anywherenear Dallas, come check us out.I think back to August 30, 1983 \u2013 my birthday \u2013 when I went to see Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin), carrying a1\n1\u20444-page purchase proposal for NFM that I had drafted. (It\u2019s reproduced on pages 114 - 115.) Mrs. B accepted myoffer without changing a word, and we completed the deal without the involvement of investment bankers orlawyers (an experience that can only be described as heavenly). Though the company\u2019s financial statements wereunaudited, I had no worries. Mrs. B simply told me what was what, and her word was good enough for me.Mrs. B was 89 at the time and worked until 103 \u2013 definitely my kind of woman. Take a look at NFM\u2019sfinancial statements from 1946 on pages 116 - 117. Everything NFM now owns comes from (a) that $72,264 of networth and $50 \u2013nozeros omitted \u2013 of cash the company then possessed, and (b) the incredible talents of Mrs. B,her son, Louie, and his sons Ron and Irv.The punch line to this story is that Mrs. B never spent a day in school. Moreover, she emigrated fromRussia to America knowing not a word of English. But she loved her adopted country: At Mrs. B\u2019s request, thefamily always sangGod Bless Americaat its gatherings.Aspiring business managers should look hard at the plain, but rare, attributes that produced Mrs. B\u2019sincredible success. Students from 40 universities visit me every year, and I have them start the day with a visit toNFM. If they absorb Mrs. B\u2019s lessons, they need none from me.Finance and Financial Products\u201cClayton\u2019s loan portfolio will likely grow to at least $5 billion in not too many years and, with sensiblecredit standards in place, should deliver significant earnings.\u201d\u2014 2003 Annual ReportThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), as well asClayton Homes, the country\u2019s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-owned subsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest inBerkadia Commercial Mortgage.Clayton is placed in this section because it owns and services 326,569 mortgages, totaling $13.6 billion. Inrecent years, as manufactured home sales plummeted, a high percentage of Clayton\u2019s earnings came from thismortgage business.In 2013, however, the sale of new homes began to pick up and earnings from both manufacturing andretailing are again becoming significant. Clayton remains America\u2019s number one homebuilder: Its 2013 output of29,547 homes accounted for about 4.7% of all single-family residences built in the country. Kevin Clayton,Clayton\u2019s CEO, has done a magnificent job of guiding the company through the severe housing depression. Now,his job \u2013 definitely more fun these days \u2013 includes the prospect of another earnings gain in 2014.\n15CORT and XTRA are leaders in their industries as well. And Jeff Pederson and Bill Franz will keep themon top.

At yearend these shares were worth $10.9billion. We are likely to purchase the shares just before expiration of our option. In the meantime, it is important foryou to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fifth largest equity investment and one we value highly.In addition to our equity holdings, we also invest substantial sums in bonds. Usually, we\u2019ve done well inthese. But not always.Most of you have never heard of Energy Future Holdings. Consider yourselves lucky; I certainly wish Ihadn\u2019t. The company was formed in 2007 to effect a giant leveraged buyout of electric utility assets in Texas. Theequity owners put up $8 billion and borrowed a massive amount in addition. About $2 billion of the debt waspurchased by Berkshire, pursuant to a decision I made without consulting with Charlie. That was a bigmistake. Unless natural gas prices soar, EFH will almost certainly file for bankruptcy in 2014. Last year, we soldour holdings for $259 million. While owning the bonds, we received $837 million in cash interest. Overall,therefore, we suffered a pre-tax loss of $873 million. Next time I\u2019ll call Charlie.A few of our subsidiaries \u2013 primarily electric and gas utilities \u2013 use derivatives in their operations.Otherwise, we have not entered into any derivative contracts for some years, and our existing positions continue torun off. The contracts that have expired have delivered large profits as well as several billion dollars of medium-term float. Though there are no guarantees, we expect a similar result from those remaining on our books.Some Thoughts About InvestingInvestment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.\u2014The Intelligent Investorby Benjamin GrahamIt is fitting to have a Ben Graham quote open this discussion because I owe so much of what I know aboutinvesting to him. I will talk more about Ben a bit later, and I will even sooner talk about common stocks. But let mefirst tell you about two small non-stock investments that I made long ago. Though neither changed my net worth bymuch, they are instructive.This tale begins in Nebraska. From 1973 to 1981, the Midwest experienced an explosion in farm prices,caused by a widespread belief that runaway inflation was coming and fueled by the lending policies of small ruralbanks. Then the bubble burst, bringing price declines of 50% or more that devastated both leveraged farmers andtheir lenders. Five times as many Iowa and Nebraska banks failed in that bubble\u2019s aftermath than in our recentGreat Recession.In 1986, I purchased a 400-acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from the FDIC. It cost me$280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothingabout operating a farm. But I have a son who loves farming and I learned from him both how many bushels of cornand soybeans the farm would produce and what the operating expenses would be. From these estimates, Icalculated the normalized return from the farm to then be about 10%. I also thought it was likely that productivitywould improve over time and that crop prices would move higher as well. Both expectations proved out.I needed no unusual knowledge or intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside andpotentially had substantial upside. There would, of course, be the occasional bad crop and prices would sometimesdisappoint. But so what? There would be some unusually good years as well, and I would never be under anypressure to sell the property. Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is worth five times or morewhat I paid. I still know nothing about farming and recently made just my second visit to the farm.\n17In 1993, I made another small investment. Larry Silverstein, Salomon\u2019s landlord when I was thecompany\u2019s CEO, told me about a New York retail property adjacent to NYU that the Resolution Trust Corp. wasselling. Again, a bubble had popped \u2013 this one involving commercial real estate \u2013 and the RTC had been created todispose of the assets of failed savings institutions whose optimistic lending practices had fueled the folly.Here, too, the analysis was simple. As had been the case with the farm, the unleveraged current yield fromthe property was about 10%. But the property had been undermanaged by the RTC, and its income would increasewhen several vacant stores were leased. Even more important, the largest tenant \u2013 who occupied around 20% of theproject\u2019s space \u2013 was paying rent of about $5 per foot, whereas other tenants averaged $70. The expiration of thisbargain lease in nine years was certain to provide a major boost to earnings. The property\u2019s location was alsosuperb: NYU wasn\u2019t going anywhere.I joined a small group, including Larry and my friend Fred Rose, that purchased the parcel. Fred was anexperienced, high-grade real estate investor who, with his family, would manage the property. And manage it theydid. As old leases expired, earnings tripled. Annual distributions now exceed 35% of our original equityinvestment. Moreover, our original mortgage was refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed severalspecial distributions totaling more than 150% of what we had invested. I\u2019ve yet to view the property.Income from both the farm and the NYU real estate will probably increase in the decades to come. Thoughthe gains won\u2019t be dramatic, the two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and,subsequently, for my children and grandchildren.I tell these tales to illustrate certain fundamentals of investing:\n\u0160You don\u2019t need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns. But if you aren\u2019t, youmust recognize your limitations and follow a course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simpleand don\u2019t swing for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick \u201cno.\u201d\n\u0160Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable making a roughestimate of the asset\u2019s future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate everyinvestment possibility. But omniscience isn\u2019t necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.\n\u0160If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating.There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and Iam skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will win their firsttoss;noneof those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play the game. And the fact thata given asset has appreciated in the recent past is nevera reason to buy it.\n\u0160With my two small investments, I thoughtonlyof what the properties would produce and cared not at allabout their daily valuations. Games are won by players who focus on the playing field \u2013 not by thosewhose eyes are glued to the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stockprices, give it a try on weekdays.\n\u0160Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time.Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hearTV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey Mantle\u2019sscathing comment: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how easy this game is until you get into that broadcasting booth.\u201d)\n18\u0160My two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993. What the economy, interest rates, or the stock marketmight do in the years immediately following \u2013 1987 and 1994 \u2013 was of no importance to me in makingthose investments. I can\u2019t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time. Whatever thechatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would flock to NYU.There is one major difference between my two small investments and an investment in stocks. Stocksprovide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farmor the New York real estate.It should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuationsplaced on their holdings \u2013 and for some investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering myproperty yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his \u2013 and those pricesvaried widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state \u2013 how in the world could I be other thanbenefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I wouldbuy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.Owners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow ownerscause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interestrates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits \u2013 and, worse yet,important to consider acting upon their comments.Those people who can sit quietly for decades when they own a farm or apartment house too often becomefrenetic when they are exposed to a stream of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering animplied message of \u201cDon\u2019t just sit there,dosomething.\u201d For these investors, liquidity is transformed from theunqualified benefit it should be to a curse.A \u201cflash crash\u201d or some other extreme market fluctuation can\u2019t hurt an investor any more than an erraticand mouthy neighbor can hurt my farm investment. Indeed, tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor ifhe has cash available when prices get far out of line with values. A climate of fear is your friendwhen investing; a euphoric world is your enemy.During the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008, I never gave a thought to selling myfarm or New York real estate, even though a severe recession was clearly brewing. And, if I had owned 100% of asolid business with good long-term prospects, it would have been foolish for me to even consider dumping it. Sowhy would I have sold my stocks that were small participations in wonderful businesses? True, any one of themmight eventually disappoint, but as a group they were certain to do well. Could anyone really believe the earth wasgoing to swallow up the incredible productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America? ************When Charlie and I buy stocks \u2013 which we think of as small portions of businesses \u2013 our analysis is verysimilar to that which we use in buying entire businesses. We first have to decide whether we can sensibly estimatean earnings range for five years out, or more. If the answer is yes, we will buy the stock (or business) if it sells at areasonable price in relation to the bottom boundary of our estimate. If, however, we lack the ability to estimatefuture earnings \u2013 which is usually the case \u2013 we simply move on to other prospects. In the 54 years we have workedtogether, we haveneverforegone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment, or the viewsof other people. In fact, these subjects never come up when we make decisions.It\u2019s vital, however, that we recognize the perimeter of our \u201ccircle of competence\u201d and stay well inside ofit. Even then, we will make some mistakes, both with stocks and businesses. But they will not be the disasters thatoccur, for example, when a long-rising market induces purchases that are based on anticipated price behavior and adesire to be where the action is.\n19Most investors, of course, have not made the study of business prospects a priority in their lives. If wise,they will conclude that they do not know enough about specific businesses to predict their future earning power.I have good news for these non-professionals: The typical investor doesn\u2019t need this skill. In aggregate,American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, inunpredictablefits and starts). In the 20\nthCentury, the Dow Jones Industrials index advanced from 66 to 11,497,paying a rising stream of dividends to boot. The 21\nstCentury will witness further gains, almost certain to be substantial. The goal of the non-professional should not be to pick winners \u2013 neither he nor his \u201chelpers\u201d can dothat \u2013 but should rather be to own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-costS&P 500 index fund will achieve this goal.That\u2019s the \u201cwhat\u201d of investing for the non-professional. The \u201cwhen\u201d is also important. The main danger isthat the timid or beginning investor will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then becomedisillusioned when paper losses occur. (Remember the late Barton Biggs\u2019 observation: \u201cA bull market is like sex. Itfeels best just before it ends.\u201d) The antidote to that kind of mistiming is for an investor to accumulate shares over along period and never to sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. Following those rules, the\u201cknow-nothing\u201d investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimalis virtually certain to get satisfactory results. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long-term results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness.If \u201cinvestors\u201d frenetically bought and sold farmland to each other, neither the yields nor prices of theircrops would be increased. The only consequence of such behavior would be decreases in the overall earningsrealized by the farm-owning population because of the substantial costs it would incur as it sought advice andswitched properties.Nevertheless, both individuals and institutions will constantly be urged to be active by those who profitfrom giving advice or effecting transactions. The resulting frictional costs can be huge and, for investors inaggregate, devoid of benefit. So ignore the chatter, keep your costs minimal, and invest in stocks as you would in afarm.My money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to certaininstructions I\u2019ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife\u2019sbenefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because allof my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trusteecould not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard\u2019s.) I believe the trust\u2019s long-term results from this policy will be superior tothose attained by most investors \u2013 whether pension funds, institutions or individuals \u2013 who employ high-feemanagers. ************And now back to Ben Graham. I learned most of the thoughts in this investment discussion from Ben\u2019sbookThe Intelligent Investor, which I bought in 1949. My financial life changed with that purchase.Before reading Ben\u2019s book, I had wandered around the investing landscape, devouring everything writtenon the subject. Much of what I read fascinated me: I tried my hand at charting and at using market indicia to predictstock movements. I sat in brokerage offices watching the tape roll by, and I listened to commentators. All of thiswas fun, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere.In contrast, Ben\u2019s ideas were explained logically in elegant, easy-to-understand prose (without Greekletters or complicated formulas). For me, the key points were laid out in what later editions labeled Chapters 8 and20. (The original 1949 edition numbered its chapters differently.) These points guide my investing decisions today.\n20A couple of interesting sidelights about the book: Later editions included a postscript describing anunnamed investment that was a bonanza for Ben. Ben made the purchase in 1948 when he was writing the firstedition and \u2013 brace yourself \u2013 the mystery company was GEICO. If Ben had not recognized the special qualities ofGEICO when it was still in its infancy, my future and Berkshire\u2019s would have been far different.The 1949 edition of the book also recommended a railroad stock that was then selling for $17 and earningabout $10 per share. (One of the reasons I admired Ben was that he had the guts to use current examples, leavinghimself open to sneers if he stumbled.) In part, that low valuation resulted from an accounting rule of the time thatrequired the railroad to exclude from its reported earnings the substantial retained earnings of affiliates.The recommended stock was Northern Pacific, and its most important affiliate was Chicago, Burlingtonand Quincy. These railroads are now important parts of BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), which is today fullyowned by Berkshire. When I read the book, Northern Pacific had a market value of about $40 million. Now itssuccessor (having added a great many properties, to be sure) earnsthat amount every four days. I can\u2019t remember what I paid for that first copy of The Intelligent Investor. Whatever the cost, it would underscore the truth of Ben\u2019s adage: Price is what you pay, value is what you get. Of all the investments I evermade, buying Ben\u2019s book was the best (except for my purchase of two marriage licenses). ************Local and state financial problems are accelerating, in large part because public entities promised pensionsthey couldn\u2019t afford. Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm thatwas born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them. Unfortunately, pensionmathematics today remain a mystery to most Americans.Investment policies, as well, play an important role in these problems. In 1975, I wrote a memo toKatharine Graham, then chairman of The Washington Post Company, about the pitfalls of pension promises and theimportance of investment policy. That memo is reproduced on pages 118 - 136.During the next decade, you will read a lot of news \u2013 badnews \u2013 about public pension plans. I hope my memo is helpful to you in understanding the necessity for prompt remedial action where problems exist.The Annual MeetingThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 3\nrdat the CenturyLink Center. Carrie Sova, our talented ringmaster, will be in charge, and all of our headquarters group will pitch in to help her. Our gang both does abetter job than professional event planners would and \u2013 yes \u2013 saves us money.CenturyLink\u2019s doors will open at 7 a.m., and at 7:30 we will have our third International NewspaperTossing Challenge. Our target will be a Clayton Home porch, precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. I tossedabout 500,000 papers when I was a teenager, so I think I\u2019m pretty good. Challenge me: I\u2019ll buy a Dilly Bar foranyone who lands his or her throw closer to the doorstep than I do. The papers will be 36 to 42 pages, and you mustfold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).At 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answerperiod, which (with a break for lunch at CenturyLink\u2019s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie andI will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day\u2019s question periods, please do sowhileCharlieis talking.\n21The best reason to exit, of course, is toshop. We\u2019ll assist you by filling the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your part, andmost locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,062 pairs of Justin boots (that\u2019s a pair every32 seconds), 12,792 pounds of See\u2019s candy, 11,162 Quikut knives (21 knives per minute) and 6,344 pairs of WellsLamont gloves, always a hot item. This year, Charlie and I will have competing ketchup bottles for sale. Naturally,the one with Charlie\u2019s picture will be heavily discounted. But, if you help, my bottle will outsell his. This isimportant, so don\u2019t let me down.Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.After you purchase a pair, wear them the next day at our second annual \u201cBerkshire 5K,\u201d an 8 a.m. race starting atthe CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor\u2019s Guide that you will receive withyour tickets for the meeting. Entrants will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire\u2019s managers,directors and associates.GEICO will have a booth in the shopping area, staffed by a number of its top counselors from around thecountry. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: Thediscount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.) Bring the details of yourexisting insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For at least half of you, I believe we can.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of newtitles. One is Max Olson\u2019s compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965. The book includes an index that Ifind particularly useful, specifying page numbers for individuals, companies and subject matter. I also recommendForty Chancesby my son, Howard. You\u2019ll enjoy it.If you are a big spender \u2013 or aspire to become one \u2013 visit Signature Flight Support on the east side of theOmaha airport between noon and 5 p.m. on Saturday. There, we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft sure to set yourpulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet. Live a little.An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up pricesfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versusOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1\u20442hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. Spend the savings with us.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72\nndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having \u201cBerkshire Weekend\u201d discount pricing. Last year in the week surrounding the meeting, the storedid $40.2 million of business, breaking its previous record by 12%. It also set a single day record of $8.2 million onSaturday, selling nearly $1 million of mattresses alone.To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 29\nthand Monday, May 5\nthinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period\u2019s special pricing will even applyto the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting butwhich, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation.NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday thisyear, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 2\nnd. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 4th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded sales in allof December, normally a jeweler\u2019s best month.\n22About 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, I will begin clerking at Borsheims. Ask for my \u201cCrazy Warren\u201d quote on theitem of your choice. As I get older, my pricing gets ever more ridiculous. Come take advantage of me.We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 28\nththrough Saturday, May 10th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement thatshows you are a Berkshire holder.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,will take on all comers \u2013 who will have their eyes wide open \u2013 in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, aremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world\u2019s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.Don\u2019t play them for money.My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. Lastyear, she made Americans \u2013 and especially me \u2013 proud with her performance at the Olympics.I met Ariel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she\u2019s afreshman at Princeton and the U.S. Women\u2019s Champion. If you don\u2019t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skillsagainst her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.Gorat\u2019s and Piccolo\u2019s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 4\nth. Both will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat\u2019s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo\u2019s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurants aremy favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat\u2019s, call402-551-3733 on April 1\nst(but not before) and for Piccolo\u2019s call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo\u2019s order a giant root beerfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at themeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists andtheir e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; BeckyQuick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, atarsorkin@nytimes.com.From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interestingand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is selected.)We will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist willbe Jay Gelb of Barclays. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come from Jonathan Brandt ofRuane, Cunniff & Goldfarb.And we will again have a credentialed bear on Berkshire. We would like to hear from applicants who areshort Berkshire (please include evidence of your position). The three analysts will bring their own Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience in asking them.Charlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire informationsimultaneously and should also have adequate time to analyze it. That\u2019s why we try to issue financial informationlate on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays. We do not talk one-on-oneto large institutional investors or analysts, but rather treat allshareholders the same. Our hope is that the journalists and analysts will ask questions that further educate our owners about their investment.\n23Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalistsand analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that\u2019s the way we like it. All told, we expect at least54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is someextra time, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that willtake place at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 15 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room. ************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Mosthave no financial need to work; the joy of hitting business \u201chome runs\u201d means as much to them as their paycheck.Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. Thisgroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 23,000-page Federalincome tax return as well as state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, getsout the annual report, prepares for the country\u2019s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\u2019s activities \u2013 and thelist goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handleall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smothered inketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.In closing, I think it\u2019s become appropriate to ignore our \u201cno pictures\u201d policy and let you view ourremarkable home-office crew. Below is a photo from our Christmas lunch. Two people couldn\u2019t make it; otherwiseyou are looking at all of those who staff Berkshire\u2019s headquarters. They are truly miracle-workers.Next year\u2019s letter will review our 50 years at Berkshire and speculate a bit about the next 50. In themeantime, come to Omaha on May 3\nrdand enjoy our Woodstock for Capitalists.February 28, 2014Warren E.

Starting in 1979,accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which waspreviously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire\u2019s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects , the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax.I fa corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over theyears, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2015 was $15.4 billion, which increased the per-share book value ofboth our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%. Over the last 51 years (that is, since present management took over),per-share book value has grown from $19 to $155,501, a rate of 19.2% compounded annually.*During the first half of those years, Berkshire\u2019s net worth was roughly equal to the number that reallycounts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of ourresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the tax thatwould be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very large part\u201cmarked to market.\u201dBy the early 1990s, however, our focus had changed to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift thatdiminished the relevance of balance-sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because the accounting rules that applyto controlled companies are materially different from those used in valuing marketable securities. The carryingvalue of the \u201closers\u201d we own is written down, but \u201cwinners\u201d are neverrevalued upwards. We\u2019ve had experience with both outcomes: I\u2019ve made some dumb purchases, and the amount I paid for theeconomic goodwill of those companies was later written off, a move that reduced Berkshire\u2019s book value. We\u2019vealso had some winners \u2013 a few of them very big \u2013 but have not written those up by a penny.Over time, this asymmetrical accounting treatment (with which we agree) necessarily widens the gapbetween intrinsic value and book value. Today, the large \u2013 and growing \u2013 unrecorded gains at our \u201cwinners\u201d make itclear that Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic valuefarexceeds its book value. That\u2019s why we would be delighted to repurchaseour shares should they sell as low as 120% of book value. At that level, purchases would instantly and meaningfullyincrease per-share intrinsic value for Berkshire\u2019s continuing shareholders.The unrecorded increase in the value of our owned businesses explains why Berkshire\u2019s aggregate market-value gain \u2013 tabulated on the facing page \u2013 materially exceeds our book-value gain. The two indicators varyerratically over short periods. Last year, for example, book-value performance was superior. Over time, however,market-value gains should continue their historical tendency to exceed gains in book value.* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500\nthof those shown for A.3The Year at BerkshireCharlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire\u2019s normalizedearning power to increase every year. (Actualyear-to-year earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of weaknessin the U.S. economy or, possibly, because of insurance mega-catastrophes.) In some years the normalized gains willbe small; at other times they will be material. Last year was a good one. Here are the highlights:\n\u2039 The most important development at Berkshire during 2015 was not financial, though it led to betterearnings. After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service tocustomers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capitalexpenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annualdepreciation charge. It was money well spent.BNSF moves about 17% of America\u2019s intercity freight (measured by revenue ton-miles), whethertransported by rail, truck, air, water or pipeline. In that respect, we are a strong number one among theseven large American railroads (two of which are Canadian-based), carrying 45% more ton-miles of freightthan our closest competitor. Consequently, our maintaining first-class service is not only vital to ourshippers\u2019 welfare but also important to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy.For most American railroads, 2015 was a disappointing year. Aggregate ton-miles fell, and earningsweakened as well. BNSF, however, maintained volume, and pre-tax income rose to a record $6.8 billion*(a gain of $606 million from 2014). Matt Rose and Carl Ice, the managers of BNSF, have my thanks anddeserve yours.\n\u2039 BNSF is the largest of our \u201cPowerhouse Five,\u201d a group that also includes Berkshire Hathaway Energy,Marmon, Lubrizol and IMC. Combined, these companies \u2013 our five most profitable non-insurancebusinesses \u2013 earned $13.1 billion in 2015, an increase of $650 million over 2014.Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us in 2003.Subsequently, we purchased three of the other four on an all-cash basis. In acquiring BNSF, however, wepaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshireby the five companies over the twelve-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. Thatsatisfies our goal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-shareresults.\n\u2039 Next year, I will be discussing the \u201cPowerhouse Six.\u201d The newcomer will be Precision Castparts Corp.(\u201cPCC\u201d), a business that we purchased a month ago for more than $32 billion of cash. PCC fits perfectlyinto the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalizedper-share earning power. Under CEO Mark Donegan, PCC has become the world\u2019s premier supplier of aerospace components (mostof them destined to be original equipment, though spares are important to the company as well). Mark\u2019saccomplishments remind me of the magic regularly performed by Jacob Harpaz at IMC, our remarkableIsraeli manufacturer of cutting tools. The two men transform very ordinary raw materials into extraordinaryproducts that are used by major manufacturers worldwide. Each is the da Vinci of his craft.PCC\u2019s products, often delivered under multi-year contracts, are key components in most large aircraft.Other industries are served as well by the company\u2019s 30,466 employees, who work out of 162 plants in 13countries. In building his business, Mark has made many acquisitions and will make more. We lookforward to having him deploy Berkshire\u2019s capital.\n* Throughout this letter, all earnings are stated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated. 4A personal thank-you: The PCC acquisition would not have happened without the input and assistance ofour own Todd Combs, who brought the company to my attention a few years ago and went on to educateme about both the business and Mark. Though Todd and Ted Weschler are primarily investment managers\u2013 they each handle about $9 billion for us \u2013 both of them cheerfully and ably add major value to Berkshirein other ways as well. Hiring these two was one of my best moves.\n\u2039With the PCC acquisition, Berkshire will own 101\u20444companies that would populate the Fortune 500 if they were stand-alone businesses. (Our 27% holding of Kraft Heinz is the\n1\u20444.) That leaves just under 98% of America\u2019s business giants that have yet to call us. Operators are standing by.\n\u2039Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.7 billion last year, up from $5.1 billion in2014. Within this group, we have one company that last year earned more than $700 million, two thatearned between $400 million and $700 million, seven that earned between $250 million and $400 million,six that earned between $100 million and $250 million, and eleven that earned between $50 million and$100 million. We love them all: This collection of businesses will expand both in number and earnings asthe years go by.\n\u2039When you hear talk about America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, rest assured that they\u2019re not talking aboutBerkshire. We invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment last year, a full 86% of it deployed inthe United States.I told you earlier about BNSF\u2019s record capital expenditures in 2015. At the end of everyyear, our railroad\u2019s physical facilities will be improved from those existing twelve months earlier.Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) is a similar story. That company has invested $16 billion inrenewables and now owns 7% of the country\u2019s wind generation and 6% of its solar generation. Indeed, the4,423 megawatts of wind generation owned and operated by our regulated utilities is sixtimes the generation of the runner-up utility.We\u2019re not done. Last year, BHE made major commitments to the future development of renewables insupport of the Paris Climate Change Conference. Our fulfilling those promises will make great sense, bothfor the environment and for Berkshire\u2019s economics.\n\u2039Berkshire\u2019s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2015 \u2013 thatmakes 13 years in a row \u2013 and increased its float. During those years, our float \u2013 money that doesn\u2019t belongto us but that we can invest for Berkshire\u2019s benefit \u2013 grew from $41 billion to $88 billion. Though neitherthat gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire\u2019s earnings, float generates significant investmentincome because of the assets it allows us to hold.Meanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $26 billion during the 13-year period, including $1.8 billionearned in 2015. Without a doubt, Berkshire\u2019s largest unrecorded wealth lies in its insurance business.We\u2019ve spent 48 years building this multi-faceted operation, and it can\u2019t be replicated.\n\u2039While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-onacquisitions. Last year we contracted for 29 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $634 million in aggregate. The costof these purchases ranged from $300,000 to $143 million.Charlie and I encourage bolt-ons,ifthey are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us most definitely aren\u2019t.)These purchases deploy capital in operations that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managedby our corps of expert managers. That means no additional work for us, yet more earnings for Berkshire, acombination we find highly appealing. We will make many dozens of bolt-on deals in future years.\n5\u2039Our Heinz partnership with Jorge Paulo Lemann, Alex Behring and Bernardo Hees more than doubled itssize last year by merging with Kraft. Before this transaction, we owned about 53% of Heinz at a cost of$4.25 billion. Now we own 325.4 million shares of Kraft Heinz (about 27%) that cost us $9.8 billion. Thenew company has annual sales of $27 billion and can supply you Heinz ketchup or mustard to go with yourOscar Mayer hot dogs that come from the Kraft side. Add a Coke, and you will be enjoying my favoritemeal. (We will have the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile at the annual meeting \u2013 bring your kids.)Though we sold no Kraft Heinz shares, \u201cGAAP\u201d (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) required usto record a $6.8 billion write-up of our investment upon completion of the merger. That leaves us with ourKraft Heinz holding carried on our balance sheet at a value many billions above our cost and many billionsbelow its market value, an outcome only an accountant could love.Berkshire also owns Kraft Heinz preferred shares that pay us $720 million annually and are carried at $7.7billion on our balance sheet. That holding will almost certainly be redeemed for $8.32 billion in June (theearliest date allowed under the preferred\u2019s terms). That will be good news for Kraft Heinz and bad news forBerkshire.Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners. We share with them a passion to buy, build andholdlarge businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires. We follow different paths, however, in pursuingthis goal.Their method, at which they have been extraordinarily successful, is to buy companies that offer anopportunity for eliminating many unnecessary costs and then \u2013 very promptly \u2013to make the moves that will get the job done. Their actions significantly boost productivity, the all-important factor in America\u2019seconomic growth over the past 240 years. Without more output of desired goods and services per workinghour \u2013 that\u2019s the measure of productivity gains \u2013 an economy inevitably stagnates. At much of corporateAmerica, truly major gains in productivity are possible, a fact offering opportunities to Jorge Paulo and hisassociates.At Berkshire, we, too, crave efficiency and detest bureaucracy. To achieve our goals, however, we followan approach emphasizingavoidanceof bloat, buying businesses such as PCC that have long been run bycost-conscious and efficient managers. After the purchase, ourrole is simply to create an environment in which these CEOs \u2013 and their eventual successors, who typically are like-minded \u2013 can maximize boththeir managerial effectiveness and the pleasure they derive from their jobs. (With this hands-off style, I amheeding a well-known Mungerism: \u201cIf you want to guarantee yourself a lifetime of misery, be sure tomarry someone with the intent of changing their behavior.\u201d)We will continue to operate with extreme \u2013 indeed, almost unheard of \u2013 decentralization at Berkshire. Butwe will also look for opportunities to partner with Jorge Paulo, either as a financing partner, as was thecase when his group purchased Tim Horton\u2019s, or as a combined equity-and-financing partner, as at Heinz.We also may occasionally partner with others, as we have successfully done at Berkadia.Berkshire, however, will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions. To be sure, certain hostileoffers are justified: Some CEOs forget that it is shareholders for whom they should be working, while othermanagers are woefully inept. In either case, directors may be blind to the problem or simply reluctant tomake the change required. That\u2019s when new faces are needed. We, though, will leave these \u201copportunities\u201dfor others. At Berkshire, we go only where we are welcome.\n6\u2039Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its \u201cBig Four\u201d investments \u2013 AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing ourownership to 8.4% versus 7.8% at yearend 2014) and Wells Fargo (going to 9.8% from 9.4%). At the othertwo companies, Coca-Cola and American Express, stock repurchases raised our percentage ownership. Ourequity in Coca-Cola grew from 9.2% to 9.3%, and our interest in American Express increased from 14.8%to 15.6%. In case you think these seemingly small changes aren\u2019t important, consider this math: For thefour companies in aggregate, each increase of one percentage point in our ownership raises Berkshire\u2019sportion of their annual earnings by about $500 million.These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented andshareholder-oriented. Their returns on tangible equity range from excellent to staggering. At Berkshire, wemuch prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100% ofa so-so business. It\u2019s better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone.If Berkshire\u2019s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the \u201cBig Four\u2019s\u201d 2015 earningsamounted to $4.7 billion. In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends theypay us \u2013 about $1.8 billion last year. But make no mistake: The nearly $3 billion of these companies\u2019earnings we don\u2019t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.The earnings our investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock \u2013 a move that increasesBerkshire\u2019s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. The retained earnings of thesecompanies also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time. Ifgains do indeed materialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and so, too, will our unrealized capitalgains.Our flexibility in capital allocation \u2013 our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlledbusinesses \u2013 gives us a significant edge over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they willoperate. Woody Allen once explained that the advantage of being bi-sexual is that it doubles your chanceof finding a date on Saturday night. In like manner \u2013 well, not exactly like manner \u2013 our appetite for eitheroperating businesses or passive investments doubles ourchances of finding sensible uses for Berkshire\u2019s endless gusher of cash. Beyond that, having a huge portfolio of marketable securities gives us a stockpileof funds that can be tapped when an elephant-sized acquisition is offered to us.************It\u2019s an election year, and candidates can\u2019t stop speaking about our country\u2019s problems (which, of course,onlytheycan solve). As a result of this negative drumbeat, many Americans now believe that their children will notlive as well as they themselves do.That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.American GDP per capita is now about $56,000. As I mentioned last year that \u2013 in real terms \u2013is a staggering six times the amount in 1930, the year I was born, a leap far beyond the wildest dreams of my parents ortheir contemporaries. U.S. citizens are not intrinsically more intelligent today, nor do they work harder than didAmericans in 1930. Rather, they work far more efficiently and thereby produce far more. This all-powerful trend iscertain to continue: America\u2019s economic magic remains alive and well.Some commentators bemoan our current 2% per year growth in real GDP \u2013 and, yes, we would all like tosee a higher rate. But let\u2019s do some simple math using the much-lamented 2% figure. That rate, we will see, deliversastounding gains.\n7America\u2019s population is growing about .8% per year (.5% from births minus deaths and .3% from netmigration). Thus 2% ofoverallgrowth produces about 1.2% ofper capitagrowth. That may not sound impressive. But in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4% in realGDP per capita. (Compounding\u2019s effects produce the excess over the percentage that would result by simply multiplying 25 x 1.2%.)In turn, that 34.4% gain will produce a staggering $19,000 increase in real GDP per capitafor the next generation. Were that to be distributed equally, the gain would be $76,000 annually for a family of four. Today\u2019s politiciansneed not shed tears for tomorrow\u2019s children.Indeed, most oftoday\u2019schildren are doing well.Allfamilies in my upper middle-class neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth. Hisunparalleled fortune couldn\u2019t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is \u2013 to name just a few \u2013transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; hecould not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do.Though the pie to be shared by the next generation will be farlarger than today\u2019s, how it will be divided will remain fiercely contentious. Just as is now the case, there will be struggles for the increased output of goodsand services between those people in their productive years and retirees, between the healthy and the infirm,between the inheritors and the Horatio Algers, between investors and workers and, in particular, between those withtalents that are valued highly by the marketplace and the equally decent hard-working Americans who lack the skillsthe market prizes. Clashes of that sort have forever been with us \u2013 and will forever continue. Congress will be thebattlefield; money and votes will be the weapons. Lobbying will remain a growth industry.The good news, however, is that even members of the \u201closing\u201d sides will almost certainly enjoy \u2013 as they should\u2013 far more goods and services in the future than they have in the past. The quality of their increased bountywill also dramatically improve. Nothing rivals the market system in producing what people want \u2013 nor, even moreso, in delivering what people don\u2019t yet know they want. My parents, when young, could not envision a televisionset, nor did I, in my 50s, think I needed a personal computer. Both products, once people saw what they could do,quickly revolutionized their lives. I now spend ten hours a week playing bridge online. And, as I write this letter,\u201csearch\u201d is invaluable to me. (I\u2019m not ready for Tinder, however.)For 240 years it\u2019s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start. America\u2019sgolden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America\u2019s social securitypromises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. And, yes, America\u2019s kids will live far better than theirparents did.************Considering this favorable tailwind, Berkshire (and, to be sure, a great many other businesses) will almostcertainly prosper. The managers who succeed Charlie and me will build Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic value byfollowing our simple blueprint of: (1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries;(2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees;(4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and(5) making an occasional large acquisition. Management will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.\n8Intrinsic Business ValueAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that numberis for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). It is possible, however, to make a sensible estimate. In our2010 annual report we laid out the three elements \u2013 one of them qualitative \u2013 that we believe are the keys to anestimation of Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 113-114.Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2015 our per-share cash and investments increased8.3% to $159,794 (with our Kraft Heinz shares stated at market value), and earnings from our many businesses \u2013including insurance underwriting income \u2013increased 2.1% to $12,304 per share. We exclude in the second factorthe dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a double-countingof value. In arriving at our earnings figure, we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortizationand minority interests. Income taxes, though, are not deducted. That is, the earnings are pre-tax . I used the italics in the paragraph above because we are for the first time including insurance underwritingincome in business earnings. We did not do that when we initially introduced Berkshire\u2019s two quantitative pillars ofvaluation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages. If the wind didn\u2019tblow and the earth didn\u2019t shake, we made large profits. But a mega-catastrophe would produce red ink. In order tobe conservative then in stating our business earnings, we consistently assumed that underwriting would break evenover time and ignored any of its gains or losses in our annual calculation of the second factor of value.Today, our insurance results are likely to be more stable than was the case a decade or two ago because wehave deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our bread-and-butter lines of business. Last year,our underwriting income contributed $1,118 per share to the $12,304 per share of earnings referenced in the secondparagraph of this section. Over the past decade, annual underwriting income has averaged $1,434 per share, and weanticipate being profitable in most years. You should recognize, however, that underwriting in any given year couldwell be unprofitable, perhaps substantially so.Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and ourearnings (includingthe underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year) have grown at a 23.7% clip. It is nocoincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 45 years has increased at a rate very similar to that ofour two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main goal is to build operatingearnings.************Now, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet andincome characteristics from the others. So we\u2019ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important andenduringeconomic advantages to having them all under one roof). Our intent is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you beingthe reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (Don\u2019t get excited; this is not a switch we are considering.)InsuranceLet\u2019s look first at insurance. The property-casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) branch of that industry has been the engine thathas propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, NationalFire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property-casualty company in the world,as measured by net worth. Moreover, its intrinsic value is farin excess of the value at which it is carried on our books.\n9One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receivepremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers\u2019 compensationaccidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companiesholding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest thisfloat for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holdsusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float.Andhowwe have grown, as the following table shows:Year\nFloat (in millions)\n1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322015 87,722Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and several of our specializedoperations are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, is party toa number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it will beverygradual \u2013 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we canneverbe subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. Thisstructure is by design and is a key component in the strength of Berkshire\u2019s economic fortress. It will neverbe compromised.If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profitthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\u2013 and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it.Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorousindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insuranceindustry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormalreturns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low interest ratesthe world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings on float will steadily decrease for many yearsto come, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers. It\u2019s a good bet that industry results over the next tenyears will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly for those companies that specialize inreinsurance.As noted early in this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutiveyears, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $26.2 billion. That\u2019s no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation isthe daily focus ofallof our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drownedby poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testamentstyle.So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s bookvalue is calculated, thefullamount of our float is deducted as aliability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think offloat as strictly a liability is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims andrelated expenses \u2013 a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 \u2013 and that reduces float. Just assurely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float.\n10If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of thisliability isdramaticallyless than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \u2013because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \u2013 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out thedoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \u201cgoodwill\u201d asset that we incurred in buying ourinsurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid forthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, anygoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of ourinsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay for float of similar qualitywere we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it \u2013 to befarin excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion wecarry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000. Yet we subsequently tripledour float. Its value today is one reason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business valuesubstantially exceeds its book value.************Berkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers runningdisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risksthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources.Indeed, Berkshire isfarmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if theinsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anythingit has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of itsmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities to writebusiness in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurerswould be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.When Ajit entered Berkshire\u2019s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day\u2019s experience in theinsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to ourreinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created tens of billions ofvalue for Berkshire shareholders.************We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can\u2019t be obtained.\n11Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back on businessthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\u201dspells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s hugefloat has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re\u2019s international life reinsurance business, which has grownconsistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that causedcommentators \u2013 and me as well, briefly \u2013 to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Reis now a gem.************Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 65 years ago. GEICO is managed by TonyNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 54 years of service in 2015. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying. There is nobetter manager than Tony. In the 40 years that I\u2019ve known him, his every action has made great sense.When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage thecompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICOwould succeed because itdeservedto succeed.No onelikesto buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes to drive. The insurance consequentlyneeded is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \u2013 and onlya low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring with GEICO. So stopreading \u2013 right now! \u2013 and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.GEICO\u2019s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year afteryear. (We ended 2015 with 11.4% of the market compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control ofGEICO.) The company\u2019s low costs create a moat \u2013 an enduringone \u2013 that competitors are unable to cross. All the while, our gecko never tires of telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. Ilove hearing the little guy deliver his message: \u201c15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance.\u201d (Ofcourse, there\u2019s always a grouch in the crowd. One of my friends says he is glad that only a few animals can talk,since the ones that do speak seem unable to discuss any subject but insurance.)************In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies that primarilywrite commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually much better than that reported by their competitors. Indeed,over the past 13 years, this group has earned $4 billion from underwriting \u2013 about 13% of its premium volume \u2013while increasing its float from $943 million to $9.9 billion.Less than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBHSI\u201d), which we includein this group. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge. That move was a home run: BHSI has alreadydeveloped $1 billion of annual premium volume and, under Peter\u2019s direction, is destined to become one of theworld\u2019s leading P/C insurers.\n12Here\u2019s a recap of underwriting earnings and float by division: Underwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions) Insurance Operations\n2015 2014 2015 2014\nBH Reinsurance............................... $ 4 2 1 $ 6 0 6 $ 44,108 $ 42,454 General Re................................... 1 3 2 2 7 7 18,560 19,280 GEICO...................................... 4 6 0 1,159 15,148 13,569 Other Primary................................. 8 2 4 6 2 6 9,906 8,618\n$ 1,837 $ 2,668 $ 87,722 $ 83,921\nBerkshire\u2019s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by widemoats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesWe have two major operations, BNSF and BHE, that share important characteristics distinguishing themfrom our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combinedfinancial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement. Together, they last year accounted for 37% ofBerkshire\u2019s after-tax operating earnings.A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, withthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF\u2019s interest coverage wasmore than 8:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest, notEBITDA/ interest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\u2019s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering anessential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great and ever-wideningdiversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Thesemany sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of being owned by a strong parent, have allowedBHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt. This economic fact benefits both us andour customers.All told, BHE and BNSF invested $11.6 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment tokey components of America\u2019s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promise reasonablereturns \u2013 and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever needhuge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital providersin a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our self-interestto conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.Low prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE\u2019s average retail rate is6.8\u00a2 per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.5\u00a2. Here are the comparable industryfigures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0\u00a2, Missouri 9.3\u00a2, Illinois 9.3\u00a2, Minnesota 9.7\u00a2. The national average is10.4\u00a2. Our rock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.\n13At BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of significantdifferences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance it is carried. To supply a verycrude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was just under 3\u00a2 last year, while shipping costs for customers of the other fourmajor U.S.-based railroads were at least 40% higher, ranging from 4.2\u00a2 to 5.3\u00a2.Both BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, nostate comes close to Iowa, where last year megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 47% of allmegawatt-hours sold to our retail customers. (Additional wind projects to which we are committed will take thatfigure to 58% in 2017.)BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost500 miles. That makes the railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroads alleviate highwaycongestion \u2013 and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier traffic \u2013 in a major way.Here are the key figures for BHE and BNSF:Berkshire Hathaway Energy (89.9% owned)\nEarnings (in millions)\n2015 2014 2013\nU.K. utilities..................................................... $ 4 6 0 $ 5 2 7 $ 3 6 2Iowa utility...................................................... 3 1 4 2 9 8 2 3 0Nevada utilities.................................................. 5 8 6 5 4 9 (58) PacifiCorp (primarily Oregon and Utah)...............................1,026 1,010 982 Gas pipelines (Northern Natural and Kern River) ........................ 4 0 1 3 7 9 3 8 5 Canadian transmission utility........................................ 1 7 0 1 6 \u2014Renewable projects............................................... 1 7 5 1 9 4 5 0HomeServices................................................... 1 9 1 1 3 9 1 3 9Other (net)...................................................... 2 7 2 6 1 2\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes ....................3,350 3,138 2,102 Interest......................................................... 4 9 9 4 2 7 2 9 6Income taxes.................................................... 4 8 1 6 1 6 1 7 0\nNet earnings..................................................... $ 2,370 $ 2,095 $ 1,636\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire..................................... $ 2,132 $ 1,882 $ 1,470\nBNSF Earnings (in millions)\n2015 2014 2013\nRevenues....................................................... $ 21,967 $ 23,239 $ 22,014 Operating expenses............................................... 14,264 16,237 15,357\nOperating earnings before interest and taxes............................7,703 7,002 6,657 Interest (net)..................................................... 9 2 8 8 3 3 7 2 9Income taxes.................................................... 2,527 2,300 2,135\nNet earnings..................................................... $ 4,248 $ 3,869 $ 3,793\nI currently expect increased after-tax earnings at BHE in 2016, but lower earnings at BNSF.\n14Manufacturing, Service and Retailing OperationsOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

In contrast, the operating expensefigures above are non-GAAP because they exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization ofcertain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbersmore accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than doGAAP figures.I won\u2019t explain all of the adjustments \u2013 some are tiny and arcane \u2013 but serious investors should understandthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete in value over time, while others in no waylose value. For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Conversely, the concept of recordingcharges against other intangibles, such as customer relationships, arises from purchase-accounting rules and clearlydoes not reflect economic reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both,that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated \u2013 even though, from an investor\u2019s viewpoint, theycould not differ more.\n15In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 38, amortization charges of $1.1 billion have beendeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \u201creal,\u201d the rest not. The \u201cnon-real\u201d charges, once non-existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-realamortization charges are likely to climb further as we acquire more companies.The table on page 55 gives you the current status of our intangible assets as calculated by GAAP. We nowhave $6.8 billion left of amortizable intangibles, of which $4.1 billion will be expensed over the next five years.Eventually, of course, every dollar of these \u201cassets\u201d will be charged off. When that happens, reported earningsincrease even if true earnings are flat. (My gift to my successor.)I suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs. But it is with some trepidation that I dothat, knowing that it has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that areall too real. \u201cStock-based compensation\u201d is the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \u201ccompensation.\u201dIf compensation isn\u2019t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\u2019t belong in the calculation ofearnings, where in the world do they belong?Wall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring\u201cearnings\u201d figures fed them by managements. Maybe the offending analysts don\u2019t know any better. Or maybe theyfear losing \u201caccess\u201d to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else isplaying the game, why shouldn\u2019t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty ofpropagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors.Depreciation charges are a more complicated subject but are almost always true costs. Certainly they are atBerkshire. I wish we could keep our businesses competitive while spending less than our depreciation charge, but in51 years I\u2019ve yet to figure out how to do so. Indeed, the depreciation charge we record in our railroad business fallsfar short of the capital outlays needed to merely keep the railroad running properly, a mismatch that leads to GAAPearnings that are higher than true economic earnings. (This overstatement of earnings exists at all railroads.) WhenCEOs or investment bankers tout pre-depreciation figures such as EBITDA as a valuation guide, watch their noseslengthen while they speak.Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,you should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report. You should also subtract somethingto reflect BNSF\u2019s inadequate depreciation charge.************Let\u2019s get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, which sell products rangingfrom lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector\u2019s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Othersgenerate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.A few, however \u2013 these are serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation \u2013 have very poorreturns. In most of these cases, I was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or theindustry in which it operates, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. At other times, I stumbled inevaluating either the fidelity or the ability of incumbent managers or ones I later appointed. I will commit moreerrors; you can count on that. If we luck out, they will occur at our smaller operations.Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an averageof $25.6 billion of net tangible assets during 2015 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash andusing only token amounts of leverage, earned 18.4% after-tax on that capital.\n16Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price. Wehave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capitalwe have deployed in this sector. Earnings from the group should grow substantially in 2016 as Duracell andPrecision Castparts enter the fold.************We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, theircompetitors \u2013 both current and potential \u2013 read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged ifothers knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire,therefore, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about many of ouroperations on pages 88-91.Finance and Financial ProductsOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), andMarmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). These companies areindustry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has gained strength. Ateach of the three, we have invested more money in new equipment than have many of our competitors, and that\u2019spaid off. Dealing from strength is one of Berkshire\u2019s enduring advantages.Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the second-largesthome builder in America. Last year, the company sold 34,397 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes boughtby Americans. In contrast, the company was number three in the field, with a 14% share, when Berkshire purchasedit in 2003.Manufactured homes allow the American dream of home ownership to be achieved by lower-incomecitizens: Around 70% of new homes costing $150,000 or less come from our industry. About 46% of Clayton\u2019shomes are sold through the 331 stores we ourselves own and operate. Most of Clayton\u2019s remaining sales are made to1,395 independent retailers.Key to Clayton\u2019s operation is its $12.8 billion mortgage portfolio. We originate about 35% of all mortgages on manufactured homes. About 37% of our mortgage portfolio emanates from our retail operation, withthe balance primarily originated by independent retailers, some of which sell our homes while others market onlythe homes of our competitors.Lenders other than Clayton have come and gone. With Berkshire\u2019s backing, however, Clayton steadfastlyfinanced home buyers throughout the panic days of 2008-2009. Indeed, during that period, Clayton used preciouscapital to finance dealers who didnotsell our homes. The funds we supplied to Goldman Sachs and General Electricat that time produced headlines; the funds Berkshire quietly delivered to Clayton both made home ownershippossible for thousands of families and kept many non-Clayton dealers alive.Our retail outlets, employing simple language and large type, consistently inform home buyers ofalternative sources for financing \u2013 most of it coming from local banks \u2013 and always secure acknowledgments fromcustomers that this information has been received and read. (The form we use is reproduced in its actual size onpage 119.)\n17Mortgage-origination practices are of great importance to both the borrower and to society. There is noquestion that reckless practices in home lending played a major role in bringing on the financial panic of 2008,which in turn led to the Great Recession. In the years preceding the meltdown, a destructive and often corruptpattern of mortgage creation flourished whereby (1) an originator in, say, California would make loans and(2) promptly sell them to an investment or commercial bank in, say, New York, which would package manymortgages to serve as collateral for a dizzyingly complicated array of mortgage-backed securities to be (3) sold tounwitting institutions around the world.As if these sins weren\u2019t sufficient to create an unholy mess, imaginative investment bankers sometimesconcocted a second layer of sliced-up financing whose value depended on the junkier portions of primary offerings.(When Wall Street gets \u201cinnovative,\u201d watch out!) While that was going on, I described this \u201cdoubling-up\u201d practiceas requiring an investor to read tens of thousands of pages of mind-numbing prose to evaluate a single securitybeing offered.Both the originator and the packager of these financings had no skin in the game and were driven byvolume and mark-ups. Many housing borrowers joined the party as well, blatantly lying on their loan applicationswhile mortgage originators looked the other way. Naturally, the gamiest credits generated the most profits. SmoothWall Street salesmen garnered millions annually by manufacturing products that their customers were unable tounderstand. (It\u2019s also questionable as to whether the major rating agencies were capable of evaluating the morecomplex structures. But rate them they did.)Barney Frank, perhaps the most financially-savvy member of Congress during the panic, recently assessedthe 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, saying, \u201cThe one major weakness that I\u2019ve seen in the implementation was this decisionby the regulators not to impose risk retention on all residential mortgages.\u201d Today, some legislators andcommentators continue to advocate a 1%-to-5% retention by the originator as a way to align its interests with that ofthe ultimate lender or mortgage guarantor.At Clayton, our risk retention was, and is, 100%. When we originate a mortgage we keep it (leaving asidethe few that qualify for a government guarantee). When we make mistakes in granting credit, we therefore pay aprice \u2013 a hefty price that dwarfs any profit we realized upon the original sale of the home. Last year we had toforeclose on 8,444 manufactured-housing mortgages at a cost to us of $157 million.The average loan we made in 2015 was only $59,942, small potatoes for traditional mortgage lenders, but adaunting commitment for our many lower-income borrowers. Our buyer acquires a decent home \u2013 take a look at thehome we will have on display at our annual meeting \u2013 requiring monthly principal-and-interest payments thataverage $522.Some borrowers, of course, will lose their jobs, and there will be divorces and deaths. Others will get over-extended on credit cards and mishandle their finances. We will lose money then, and our borrower will lose hisdown payment (though his mortgage payments during his time of occupancy may have been well under rental ratesfor comparable quarters). Nevertheless, despite the low FICO scores and income of our borrowers, their paymentbehavior during the Great Recession wasfarbetter than that prevailing in many mortgage pools populated by peopleearning multiples of our typical borrower\u2019s income.The strong desire of our borrowers to have a home of their own is one reason we\u2019ve done well with ourmortgage portfolio. Equally important, we have financed much of the portfolio with floating-rate debt or with short-term fixed-rate debt. Consequently, the incredibly low short-term rates of recent years have provided us aconstantly-widening spread between our interest costs and the income we derive from our mortgage portfolio, whichbears fixed rates. (Incidentally, we would have enjoyed similar margins had we simply bought long-term bonds andfinanced the position in some short-term manner.)\n18Normally, it is risky business to lend long at fixed rates and borrow short as we have been doing atClayton. Over the years, some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that. At Berkshire, however,we possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least $20 billion in cash-equivalents that earn short-term rates. More often, our short-term investments are in the $40 billion to $60 billion range. If we have, say,$60 billion invested at\n1\u20444% or less, a sharp move to higher short-term rates would bring benefits to us far exceedingthe higher financing costs we would incur in funding Clayton\u2019s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. In banking terms,Berkshire is \u2013 and always will be \u2013 heavily asset-sensitive and will consequently benefit from rising interest rates.Let me talk about one subject of which I am particularly proud, that having to do with regulation. TheGreat Recession caused mortgage originators, servicers and packagers to come under intense scrutiny and to beassessed many billions of dollars in fines and penalties.The scrutiny has certainly extended to Clayton, whose mortgage practices have been continuouslyreviewed and examined in respect to such items as originations, servicing, collections, advertising, compliance, andinternal controls. At the federal level, we answer to the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Housing andUrban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Dozens of states regulate us as well. During thepast two years, indeed, various federal and state authorities (from 25 states) examined and reviewed Clayton and itsmortgages on 65 occasions. The result? Our total fines during this period were $38,200 and our refunds to customers$704,678. Furthermore, though we had to foreclose on 2.64% of our manufactured-home mortgages last year,95.4% of our borrowers were current on their payments at yearend, as they moved toward owning a debt-free home.************Marmon\u2019s rail fleet expanded to 133,220 units by yearend, a number significantly increased by thecompany\u2019s purchase of 25,085 cars from General Electric on September 30. If our fleet was connected to form asingle train, the engine would be in Omaha and the caboose in Portland, Maine.At yearend, 97% of our railcars were leased, with about 15-17% of the fleet coming up for renewal eachyear. Though \u201ctank cars\u201d sound like vessels carrying crude oil, only about 7% of our fleet carries that product;chemicals and refined petroleum products are the lead items we transport. When trains roll by, look for the UTLX orProcor markings that identify our tank cars. When you spot the brand, puff out your chest; you own a portion of thatcar.Here\u2019s the earnings recap for this sector: 2015\n2014 2013\n(in millions)\nBerkadia (our 50% share)............................. $ 7 4 $ 1 2 2 $ 8 0Clayton............................................ 7 0 6 5 5 8 4 1 6CORT............................................. 5 5 4 9 4 2Marmon \u2013 Containers and Cranes....................... 1 9 2 2 3 8 2 2 6Marmon \u2013 Railcars................................... 5 4 6 4 4 2 3 5 3XTRA............................................. 1 7 2 1 4 7 1 2 5Net financial income*................................ 3 4 1 2 8 3 3 2 2\n$ 2,086 $ 1,839 $ 1,564\n* Excludes capital gains or losses\n19InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.

That kind of improvement has been the secret sauce of America\u2019s remarkable gains in livingstandards since the nation\u2019s founding in 1776. Unfortunately, the label of \u201csecret\u201d is appropriate: Too fewAmericans fully grasp the linkage between productivity and prosperity. To see that connection, let\u2019s look first at thecountry\u2019s most dramatic example \u2013 farming \u2013 and later examine three Berkshire-specific areas.In 1900, America\u2019s civilian work force numbered 28 million. Of these, 11 million, a staggering 40% of thetotal, worked in farming. The leading crop then, as now, was corn. About 90 million acres were devoted to itsproduction and the yield per acre was 30 bushels, for a total output of 2.7 billion bushels annually.Then came the tractor and one innovation after another that revolutionized such keys to farm productivityas planting, harvesting, irrigation, fertilization and seed quality. Today, we devote about 85 million acres to corn.Productivity, however, has improved yields to more than 150 bushels per acre, for an annual output of 13-14 billionbushels. Farmers have made similar gains with other products.Increased yields, though, are only half the story: The huge increases in physical output have beenaccompanied by a dramatic reduction in the number of farm laborers (\u201chuman input\u201d). Today about three millionpeople work on farms, a tiny 2% of our 158-million-person work force. Thus, improved farming methods haveallowed tens of millions of present-day workers to utilize their time and talents in other endeavors, a reallocation ofhuman resources that enables Americans of today to enjoy huge quantities of non-farmgoods and services they would otherwise lack.It\u2019s easy to look back over the 115-year span and realize how extraordinarily beneficial agriculturalinnovations have been \u2013 not just for farmers but, more broadly, for our entire society. We would not have anythingclose to the America we now know had we stifled those improvements in productivity. (It was fortunate that horsescouldn\u2019t vote.) On a day-to-day basis, however, talk of the \u201cgreater good\u201d must have rung hollow to farm hands wholost their jobs to machines that performed routine tasks far more efficiently than humans ever could. We willexamine this flip-side to productivity gains later in this section.For the moment, however, let\u2019s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequencesfor Berkshire subsidiaries. Similar transformations have been commonplace throughout American business.\n\u2039In 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, the American workforce totaled 44 million. About1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton-miles of freight moved byClass I railroads that year totaled 655 billion.By 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton-miles, an increase of 182%, while employing only187,000 workers, a reduction of 86% since 1947. (Some of this change involved passenger-relatedemployees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.) As a result of this staggeringimprovement in productivity, the inflation-adjusted price for moving a ton-mile of freight has fallen by55% since 1947, a drop saving shippers about $90 billion annuallyin current dollars. Another startling statistic: If it took as many people now to move freight as it did in 1947, we would needwell over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. (Of course, that level of employmentwould raise freight charges by a lot; consequently, nothing close to today\u2019s volume would actually move.)\n21Our own BNSF was formed in 1995 by a merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe. In 1996, themerged company\u2019s first full year of operation, 411 million ton-miles of freight were transported by 45,000employees. Last year the comparable figures were 702 million ton-miles (plus 71%) and 47,000 employees(plus only 4%). That dramatic gain in productivity benefits both owners and shippers. Safety at BNSF hasimproved as well: Reportable injuries were 2.04 per 200,000 man-hours in 1996 and have since fallen morethan 50% to 0.95.\n\u2039A bit more than a century ago, the auto was invented, and around it formed an industry that insures carsand their drivers. Initially, this business was written through traditional insurance agencies \u2013 the kinddealing in fire insurance. This agency-centric approach included high commissions and other underwritingexpenses that consumed about 40\u00a2 of the premium dollar. Strong local agencies were then in the driver\u2019sseat because they represented multiple insurers and could play one company off against another whencommissions were being negotiated. Cartel-like pricing prevailed, and all involved were doing fine \u2013except for the consumer.And then some American ingenuity came into play: G. J. Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, came upwith the idea of a captive sales force that would sell the insurance products of only a single company. Hisbaby was christened State Farm Mutual. The company cut commissions and expenses \u2013 moves thatpermitted lower prices \u2013 and soon became a powerhouse. For many decades, State Farm has been therunaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner\u2019s insurance. Allstate, which also operated with adirect distribution model, was long the runner-up. Both State Farm and Allstate have had underwritingexpenses of about 25%.In the early 1930s, another contender, United Services Auto Association (\u201cUSAA\u201d), a mutual-likecompany, was writing auto insurance for military officers on a direct-to-the-customer basis. This marketinginnovation rose from a need that military personnel had to buy insurance that would stay with them as theymoved from base to base. That was business of little interest to local insurance agencies, which wanted thesteady renewals that came from permanent residents.The direct distribution method of USAA, as it happened, incurred lower costs than those enjoyed by StateFarm and Allstate and therefore delivered an even greater bargain to customers. That made Leo and LillianGoodwin, employees of USAA, dream of broadening the target market for its direct distribution modelbeyond military officers. In 1936, starting with $100,000 of capital, they incorporated GovernmentEmployees Insurance Co. (later compressing this mouthful to GEICO).Their fledgling did $238,000 of auto insurance business in 1937, its first full year. Last year GEICO did$22.6billion, more than double the volume of USAA. (Though the early bird gets the worm, the secondmouse gets the cheese.) GEICO\u2019s underwriting expenses in 2015 were 14.7% of premiums, with USAAbeing the only large company to achieve a lower percentage. (GEICO is fully as efficient as USAA butspends considerably more on advertising aimed at promoting growth.)With the price advantage GEICO\u2019s low costs allow, it\u2019s not surprising that several years ago the companyseized the number two spot in auto insurance from Allstate. GEICO is also gaining ground on State Farm,though it is still far ahead of us in volume. On August 30, 2030 \u2013 my 100\nthbirthday \u2013 I plan to announce that GEICO has taken over the top spot. Mark your calendar.GEICO employs about 34,000 people to serve its 14 million policyholders. I can only guess at theworkforce it would require to serve a similar number of policyholders under the agency system. I believe,however, that the number would be at least 60,000, a combination of what the insurer would need in directemployment and the personnel required at supporting agencies.\n22\u2039In its electric utility business, our Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) operates within a changingeconomic model. Historically, the survival of a local electric company did not depend on its efficiency. Infact, a \u201csloppy\u201d operation could do just fine financially.That\u2019s because utilities were usually the sole supplier of a needed product and were allowed to price at alevel that gave them a prescribed return upon the capital they employed. The joke in the industry was that autility was the only business that would automatically earn more money by redecorating the boss\u2019s office.And some CEOs ran things accordingly.That\u2019s all changing. Today, society has decided that federally-subsidized wind and solar generation is inour country\u2019s long-term interest. Federal tax credits are used to implement this policy, support that makesrenewables price-competitive in certain geographies. Those tax credits, or other government-mandated helpfor renewables, may eventually erode the economics of the incumbent utility, particularly if it is a high-costoperator. BHE\u2019s long-established emphasis on efficiency \u2013 even when the company didn\u2019t need it to attainauthorized earnings \u2013 leaves us particularly competitive in today\u2019s market (and, more important, intomorrow\u2019s as well).BHE acquired its Iowa utility in 1999. In the year before, that utility employed 3,700 people and produced19 million megawatt-hours of electricity. Now we employ 3,500 people and produce 29 million megawatt-hours. That major increase in efficiency allowed us to operate without a rate increase for 16 years, a periodduring which industry rates increased 44%.The safety record of our Iowa utility is also outstanding. It had .79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015compared to the rate of 7.0 experienced by the previous owner in the year before we bought the operation.In 2006 BHE purchased PacifiCorp, which operated primarily in Oregon and Utah. The year before ourpurchase PacifiCorp employed 6,750 people and produced 52.6 million megawatt-hours. Last year thenumbers were 5,700 employees and 56.3 million megawatt-hours. Here, too, safety improved dramatically,with the accident-rate-per-100-employees falling from 3.4 in 2005 to .85 in 2015. In safety, BHE nowranks in the industry\u2019s top decile.Those outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy autility in their jurisdiction. The regulators know the company will run an efficient, safe and reliableoperation and also arrive with unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense. (BHE has never paida dividend to Berkshire since we assumed ownership. No investor-owned utility in America comes close tomatching BHE\u2019s enthusiasm for reinvestment.)************The productivity gains that I\u2019ve just spelled out \u2013 and countless others that have been achieved in America\u2013 have delivered awesome benefits to society. That\u2019s the reason our citizens, as a whole, have enjoyed \u2013 and willcontinue to enjoy \u2013 major gains in the goods and services they receive.To this thought there are offsets. First, the productivity gains achieved in recent years have largelybenefitted the wealthy. Second, productivity gains frequently cause upheaval: Both capital and labor can pay aterrible price when innovation or new efficiencies upend their worlds.We need shed no tears for the capitalists (whether they be private owners or an army of publicshareholders). It\u2019s their job to take care of themselves. When large rewards can flow to investors from gooddecisions, these parties should not be spared the losses produced by wrongchoices. Moreover, investors who diversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper: In America, gains from winninginvestments have alwaysfarmore than offset the losses from clunkers. (During the 20\nthCentury, the Dow Jones Industrial Average \u2013 an index fund of sorts \u2013 soared from 66 to 11,497, with its component companies all the whilepaying ever-increasing dividends.)23A long-employed worker faces a different equation. When innovation and the market system interact toproduce efficiencies, many workers may be rendered unnecessary, their talents obsolete. Some can find decentemployment elsewhere; for others, that is not an option.When low-cost competition drove shoe production to Asia, our once-prosperous Dexter operation folded,putting 1,600 employees in a small Maine town out of work. Many were past the point in life at which they couldlearn another trade. We lost our entire investment, which we could afford, but many workers lost a livelihood theycould not replace. The same scenario unfolded in slow-motion at our original New England textile operation, whichstruggled for 20 years before expiring. Many older workers at our New Bedford plant, as a poignant example, spokePortuguese and knew little, if any, English. They had no Plan B.The answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity.Americans would not be living nearly as well as we do if we had mandated that 11 million people should forever beemployed in farming.The solution, rather, is a variety of safety nets aimed at providing a decent life for those who are willing towork but find their specific talents judged of small value because of market forces. (I personally favor a reformedand expanded Earned Income Tax Credit that would try to make sure America works for those willing to work.) Theprice of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for theunfortunate.Important RisksWe, like all public companies, are required by the SEC to annually catalog \u201crisk factors\u201d in our 10-K. Ican\u2019t remember, however, an instance when reading a 10-K\u2019s \u201crisk\u201d section has helped me in evaluating a business.That\u2019s not because the identified risks aren\u2019t real. The truly important risks, however, are usually well known.Beyond that, a 10-K\u2019s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing: (1) the probability of the threatening eventactually occurring; (2) the range of costs if it does occur; and (3) the timing of the possible loss. A threat that willonly surface 50 years from now may be a problem for society, but it is not a financialproblem for today\u2019s investor. Berkshire operates in more industries than any company I know of. Each of our pursuits has its own arrayof possible problems and opportunities. Those are easy to list but hard to evaluate: Charlie, I and our various CEOsoften differ in a very major way in our calculation of the likelihood, the timing and the cost (or benefit) that mayresult from these possibilities.Let me mention just a few examples. To begin with an obvious threat, BNSF, along with other railroads, iscertainto lose significant coal volume over the next decade. At some point in the future \u2013 though not, in my view,for a long time \u2013 GEICO\u2019s premium volumemayshrink because of driverless cars. This development could hurt our auto dealerships as well. Circulation of our print newspapers will continue to fall, a certainty we allowed for whenpurchasing them. To date, renewables have helped our utility operation but that could change, particularly if storagecapabilities for electricity materially improve. Online retailing threatens the business model of our retailers andcertain of our consumer brands. These potentialities are just a few of the negative possibilities facing us \u2013 but eventhe most casual follower of business news has long been aware of them.None of these problems, however, is crucial to Berkshire\u2019s long-term well-being. When we took over thecompany in 1965, its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence: \u201cThe northern textile business inwhich all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.\u201d That development,however, was no death knell. We simply adapted. And we will continue to do so.\n24Every day Berkshire managers are thinking about how they can better compete in an always-changingworld. Just as vigorously, Charlie and I focus on where a steady stream of funds should be deployed. In that respect,we possess a major advantage over one-industry companies, whose options are far more limited. I firmly believethat Berkshire has the money, talent and culture to plow through the sort of adversities I\u2019ve itemized above \u2013 andmany more \u2013 and to emerge with ever-greater earning power.There is, however, one clear, present and enduring danger to Berkshire against which Charlie and I arepowerless. That threat to Berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces: a \u201csuccessful\u201d (as defined by theaggressor) cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States. That is a risk Berkshire shares with all of American business.The probability of such mass destruction in any given year is likely very small. It\u2019s been more than 70years since I delivered a Washington Post newspaper headlining the fact that the United States had dropped the firstatomic bomb. Subsequently, we\u2019ve had a few close calls but avoided catastrophic destruction. We can thank ourgovernment \u2013 and luck! \u2013 for this result.Nevertheless, what\u2019s a small probability in a short period approaches certainty in the longer run. (If there isonly one chance in thirty of an event occurring in a given year, the likelihood of it occurring at least once in acentury is 96.6%.) The added bad news is that there will forever be people and organizations and perhaps evennations that would like to inflict maximum damage on our country. Their means of doing so have increasedexponentially during my lifetime. \u201cInnovation\u201d has its dark side.There is no way for American corporations or their investors to shed this risk. If an event occurs in the U.S.that leads to mass devastation, the value of all equity investments will almost certainly be decimated.No one knows what \u201cthe day after\u201d will look like. I think, however, that Einstein\u2019s 1949 appraisal remainsapt: \u201cI know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks andstones.\u201d************I am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at thisyear\u2019s annual meeting. The sponsor would like us to provide a report on the dangers that this change might presentto our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats.It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say \u201chighly likely\u201drather than \u201ccertain\u201d because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most \u201cexperts\u201dabout Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage tothe world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting thedanger.This issue bears a similarity to Pascal\u2019s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, arguedthat if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because therewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance theplanet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now isfoolhardy. Call this Noah\u2019s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how cloudless the skies appear.It\u2019s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened byclimate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that propertylosses will skyrocket because of weather changes. And such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- ortwenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repricedannually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.25Think back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO. The company\u2019s average loss-per-policywas then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increaseto about $1,000 per policy. Wouldn\u2019t such skyrocketing losses prove disastrous, you might ask? Well, no.Over the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humansinvolved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So,paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable. If costs had remained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600 million of business annually rather thanone doing $23 billion.Up to now, climate change hasnotproduced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather-related events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallensteadily in recent years, which is why we have backed away from that business. If super-cats become costlier and more frequent, the likely \u2013though far from certain \u2013 effect on Berkshire\u2019s insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable.As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in alow-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a majorinsurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.The Annual MeetingCharlie and I have finally decided to enter the 21\nstCentury. Our annual meeting this year will be webcast worldwide in its entirety. To view the meeting, simply go to https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream at 9 a.m.Central Daylight Time on Saturday, April 30\nth. The Yahoo! webcast will begin with a half hour of interviews withmanagers, directors and shareholders. Then, at 9:30, Charlie and I will commence answering questions.This new arrangement will serve two purposes. First, it may level off or modestly decrease attendance atthe meeting. Last year\u2019s record of more than 40,000 attendees strained our capacity. In addition to quickly filling theCenturyLink Center\u2019s main arena, we packed its overflow rooms and then spilled into two large meeting rooms atthe adjoining Omaha Hilton. All major hotels were sold out notwithstanding Airbnb\u2019s stepped-up presence. Airbnbwas especially helpful for those visitors on limited budgets.Our second reason for initiating a webcast is more important. Charlie is 92, and I am 85. If we werepartners with you in a small business, and were charged with running the place, you would want to look inoccasionally to make sure we hadn\u2019t drifted off into la-la land. Shareholders, in contrast, should not need to come toOmaha to monitor how we look and sound. (In making your evaluation, be kind: Allow for the fact that we didn\u2019tlook that impressive when we were at our best.)Viewers can also observe our life-prolonging diet. During the meeting, Charlie and I will each consumeenough Coke, See\u2019s fudge and See\u2019s peanut brittle to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an NFL lineman. Long agowe discovered a fundamental truth: There\u2019s nothing like eating carrots and broccoli when you\u2019re reallyhungry \u2013 and want to stay that way.Shareholders planning to attend the meeting should come at 7 a.m. when the doors open at CenturyLinkCenter andstart shopping. Carrie Sova will again be in charge of the festivities. She had her second child late lastmonth, but that did not slow her down. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out the best in thosewho work with her. She is aided by hundreds of Berkshire employees from around the country and by our entirehome office crew as well, all of them pitching in to make the weekend fun and informative for our owners.\n26Last year we increased the number of hours available for shopping at the CenturyLink. Sales skyrocketed \u2013so, naturally, we will stay with the new schedule. On Friday, April 29\nthyou can shop between noon and 5 p.m., and on Saturday exhibits and stores will be open from 7 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.On Saturday morning, we will have our fifth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our target willagain be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager \u2013 in myone brief flirtation with honest labor \u2013 I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I\u2019m pretty good at this game.Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold themyourself (no rubber bands allowed).The competition begins at 7:15, when contestants will make preliminary tosses. The eight throws judgedmost accurate \u2013 four made by contestants 12 or under, and four made by the older set \u2013 will compete against me at7:45. The young challengers will each receive a prize. But the older ones will have to beat me to take anythinghome.And be sure to check out the Clayton home itself. It can be purchased for $78,900, fully installed on landyou provide. In past years, we\u2019ve made many sales on the meeting day. Kevin Clayton will be on hand with hisorder book.At 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answerperiod, which (including a break for lunch at CenturyLink\u2019s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess,Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour orso and can safely be skipped by those craving a little last-minute shopping.Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in whichproducts from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale. Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who willbe captaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that salutes all of our subsidiaries.Your children (and you!) will be enchanted with it.We will have a new and very special exhibit in the hall this year: a full-size model of the world\u2019s largestaircraft engine, for which Precision Castparts makes many key components. The real engines weigh about 20,000pounds and are ten feet in diameter and 22 feet in length. The bisected model at the meeting will give you a goodlook at many PCC components that help power your flights.Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our fourth annual \u201cBerkshire 5K,\u201d an 8 a.m. race starting at theCenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor\u2019s Guide that will be sent to you with yourmeeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire\u2019s managers,directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; the fudge and peanut brittle take their toll.)Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help us set another record.A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company\u2019s top counselors fromaround the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount(usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplementalpoint: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.)Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spendthe savings on our other products.\n27Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of new titles.Andy Kilpatrick will introduce (and be glad to sign) the latest edition of his all-encompassing coverage ofBerkshire. It\u2019s 1,304 pages and weighs 9.8 pounds. (My blurb for the book: \u201cRidiculously skimpy.\u201d) Check outPeter Bevelin\u2019s new book as well. Peter has long been a keen observer of Berkshire.We will also have a new, 20-page-longer edition of Berkshire\u2019s 50-year commemorative book that at lastyear\u2019s meeting sold 12,000 copies. Since then, Carrie and I have uncovered additional material that we findfascinating, such as some very personal letters sent by Grover Cleveland to Edward Butler, his friend and the then-publisher ofThe Buffalo News. Nothing from the original edition has been changed or eliminated, and the priceremains $20. Charlie and I will jointly sign 100 copies that will be randomly placed among the 5,000 available forsale at the meeting.My friend, Phil Beuth, has writtenLimping on Water, an autobiography that chronicles his life at Capital Cities Communications and tells you a lot about its leaders, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. These two were the bestmanagerial duo \u2013 both inwhatthey accomplished andhowthey did it \u2013 that Charlie and I ever witnessed. Much of what you become in life depends on whom you choose to admire and copy. Start with Tom Murphy, and you\u2019llnever need a second exemplar.Finally, Jeremy Miller has writtenWarren Buffett\u2019s Ground Rules, a book that will debut at the annual meeting. Mr. Miller has done a superb job of researching and dissecting the operation of Buffett Partnership Ltd.and of explaining how Berkshire\u2019s culture has evolved from its BPL origin. If you are fascinated by investmenttheory and practice, you will enjoy this book.An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked upprices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1\u20442hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to$1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72\nndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having \u201cBerkshire Weekend\u201d discount pricing. Last year in the week encompassing the meeting, the storedid a record $44,239,493 of business. If you repeat that figure to a retailer, he is not going to believe you. (Anaverage week for NFM\u2019s Omaha store \u2013 the highest-volume home furnishings store in the United States except forour new Dallas store \u2013 is about $9 million.)To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 26\nthand Monday, May 2\nndinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period\u2019s special pricing will even apply tothe products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, inthe spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During\u201cBerkshire Weekend\u201d NFM will be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. onSaturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is hosting a picnic to whichyou are all invited.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, April 29\nth. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 1st, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. During last year\u2019s Friday-Sunday stretch, the store wrote a salesticket every 15 seconds that it was open.\n28We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25\nththrough Saturday, May 7th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showingyou own our stock.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, willbewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world\u2019s topbridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. I will join them and hope tohave Ajit and Charlie there also.My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I metAriel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she\u2019s a junior at Princeton,having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don\u2019t mind embarrassing yourself, testyour skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.Gorat\u2019s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 1\nst, serving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat\u2019s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1\nst(but not before). As for my other favorite restaurant, Piccolo\u2019s, I\u2019m sad to report it closed.We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed atloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, ofThe New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interestingand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep itconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions inany e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestion is asked.)An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year theinsurance specialist will be Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Questions that deal with our non-insuranceoperations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Ourhope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that add to our owners\u2019 understanding and knowledge oftheir investment.Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,for sure, and that\u2019s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren\u2019t allowed; we want to give as many questioners aspossible a shot at us.All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for18 from the audience. (Last year we had 64 in total.) The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphonesinstalled in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.\n29While I\u2019m on the subject of our owners\u2019 gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believeall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible,should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That\u2019s why we try to issuefinancial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. Wedo not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts, treating theminstead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder of limited meanswho trusts us with a substantial portion of his savings.************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Starswho run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most ofour managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business \u201chome runs\u201d means as much to them astheir paycheck.Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. Thisgroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,400-page Federalincome tax return \u2013 that\u2019s up 6,000 pages from the prior year! \u2013 oversees the filing of 3,530 state tax returns,responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country\u2019s largestannual meeting, coordinates the Board\u2019s activities, fact-checks this letter \u2013 and the list goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt withthe 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries(smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to workevery day. In fact, my job becomes more fun every year.In 2015, Berkshire\u2019s revenues increased by $16 billion. Look carefully, however, at the two pictures on thefacing page. The top one is from last year\u2019s report and shows the entire Berkshire home-office crew at ourChristmas lunch. Below that photo is this year\u2019s Christmas photo portraying the same25 people identically positioned. In 2015, no one joined us, no one left. And the odds are good that you will see a photo of the same 25next year.Can you imagine another very large company \u2013 we employ 361,270 people worldwide \u2013 enjoying that kindof employment stability at headquarters? At Berkshire we have hired some wonderful people \u2013 and they have stayedwith us. Moreover, no one is hired unless he or she is truly needed.

Starting in 1979,accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which waspreviously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire\u2019s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects , the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax.I fa corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over theyears, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2A note to readers: Fifty years ago, today\u2019s management took charge at Berkshire. For this Golden Anniversary,Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger each wrote his views of what has happened at Berkshire during the past 50years and what each expects during the next 50. Neither changed a word of his commentary after reading what theother had written. Warren\u2019s thoughts begin on page 24 and Charlie\u2019s on page 39. Shareholders, particularly newones, may find it useful to read those letters before reading the report on 2014, which begins below.\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2014 was $18.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value ofboth our Class A and Class B stock by 8.3%. Over the last 50 years (that is, since present management took over),per-share book value has grown from $19 to $146,186, a rate of 19.4% compounded annually.*During our tenure, we have consistently compared the yearly performance of the S&P 500 to the change inBerkshire\u2019s per-share book value. We\u2019ve done that because book value has been a crude, but useful, tracking device for the number that really counts: intrinsic business value.In our early decades, the relationship between book value and intrinsic value was much closer than it isnow. That was true because Berkshire\u2019s assets were then largely securities whose values were continuously restatedto reflect their current market prices. In Wall Street parlance, most of the assets involved in the calculation of bookvalue were \u201cmarked to market.\u201dToday, our emphasis has shifted in a major way to owning and operating large businesses. Many of theseare worth far more than their cost-based carrying value. But that amount is neverrevalued upward no matter how much the value of these companies has increased. Consequently, the gap between Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value and itsbook value has materially widened.With that in mind, we have added a new set of data \u2013 the historical record of Berkshire\u2019s stock price \u2013 tothe performance table on the facing page. Market prices, let me stress, have their limitations in the short term.Monthly or yearly movements of stocks are often erratic and not indicative of changes in intrinsic value. Over time,however, stock prices and intrinsic value almost invariably converge. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairmanand my partner, and I believe that has been true at Berkshire: In our view, the increase in Berkshire\u2019s per-shareintrinsic value over the past 50 years is roughly equal to the 1,826,163% gain in market price of the company\u2019sshares.\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500thof those shown for A.3The Year at BerkshireIt was a good year for Berkshire on all major fronts, except one. Here are the important developments:\n\u2039Our \u201cPowerhouse Five\u201d \u2013 a collection of Berkshire\u2019s largest non-insurance businesses \u2013 had a record $12.4billion of pre-tax earnings in 2014, up $1.6 billion from 2013.* The companies in this sainted group areBerkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly MidAmerican Energy), BNSF, IMC (I\u2019ve called it Iscar in the past),Lubrizol and Marmon.Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us a decade ago.Subsequently we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, wepaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased thenumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire bythe five companies over the ten-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies ourgoal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-shareresults. If the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2015, we expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to improveas well. The gain could reach $1 billion, in part because of bolt-on acquisitions by the group that havealready closed or are under contract.\n\u2039Our bad news from 2014 comes from our group of five as well and is unrelated to earnings. During theyear, BNSF disappointed many of its customers. These shippers depend on us, and service failures canbadly hurt their businesses.BNSF is, by far, Berkshire\u2019s most important non-insurance subsidiary and, to improve its performance, wewill spend $6 billion on plant and equipment in 2015. That sum is nearly 50% more than any other railroadhas spent in a single year and is a truly extraordinary amount, whether compared to revenues, earnings ordepreciation charges.Though weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operatingproblems, our responsibility is to dowhatever it takesto restore our service to industry-leading levels. That can\u2019t be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disruptsoperations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to showresults. During the last three months, BNSF\u2019s performance metrics have materially improved from lastyear\u2019s figures.\n\u2039Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.1 billion last year, up from $4.7 billion in2013. Here, as with our Powerhouse Five, we expect further gains in 2015. Within this group, we have twocompanies that last year earned between $400 million and $600 million, six that earned between $250million and $400 million, and seven that earned between $100 million and $250 million. This collection ofbusinesses will increase in both number and earnings. Our ambitions have no finish line.\n\u2039Berkshire\u2019s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2014 \u2013 thatmakes 12 years in a row \u2013 and increased its float. During that 12-year stretch, our float \u2013 money thatdoesn\u2019t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire\u2019s benefit \u2013 has grown from $41 billion to $84billion. Though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire\u2019s earnings, floatgenerates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold.* Throughout this letter, as well as in the \u201cGolden Anniversary\u201d letters included later in this report, all earnings arestated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.4Meanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $24 billion during the twelve-year period, including $2.7 billionearned in 2014. And all of this began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million.\n\u2039While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-onacquisitions. Last year was particularly fruitful: We contracted for 31 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $7.8billion in aggregate. The size of these transactions ranged from $400,000 to $2.9 billion. However, thelargest acquisition, Duracell, will not close until the second half of this year. It will then be placed underMarmon\u2019s jurisdiction.Charlie and I encourage bolt-ons,ifthey are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us aren\u2019t.) They deploycapital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expertmanagers. This means no more work for us, yet more earnings, a combination we find particularlyappealing. We will make many more of these bolt-on deals in future years.\n\u2039Two years ago my friend, Jorge Paulo Lemann, asked Berkshire to join his 3G Capital group in theacquisition of Heinz. My affirmative response was a no-brainer: I knew immediately that this partnershipwould work well from both a personal and financial standpoint. And it most definitely has.I\u2019m not embarrassed to admit that Heinz is run far better under Alex Behring, Chairman, and BernardoHees, CEO, than would be the case if I were in charge. They hold themselves to extraordinarily highperformance standards and are never satisfied, even when their results far exceed those of competitors.We expect to partner with 3G in more activities. Sometimes our participation will only involve a financingrole, as was the case in the recent acquisition of Tim Hortons by Burger King. Our favored arrangement,however, will usually be to link up as apermanentequity partner (who, in some cases, contributes to the financing of the deal as well). Whatever the structure, we feel good when working with Jorge Paulo.Berkshire also has fine partnerships with Mars and Leucadia, and we may form new ones with them or withother partners. Our participation in any joint activities, whether as a financing or equity partner, will belimited to friendly transactions.\n\u2039In October, we contracted to buy Van Tuyl Automotive, a group of 78 automobile dealerships that isexceptionally well-run. Larry Van Tuyl, the company\u2019s owner, and I met some years ago. He then decidedthat if he were ever to sell his company, its home should be Berkshire. Our purchase was recentlycompleted, and we are now \u201ccar guys.\u201dLarry and his dad, Cecil, spent 62 years building the group, following a strategy that made owner-partnersof all local managers. Creating this mutuality of interests proved over and over to be a winner. Van Tuyl isnow the fifth-largest automotive group in the country, with per-dealership sales figures that areoutstanding.In recent years, Jeff Rachor has worked alongside Larry, a successful arrangement that will continue. Thereare about 17,000 dealerships in the country, and ownership transfers always require approval by therelevant auto manufacturer. Berkshire\u2019s job is to perform in a manner that will cause manufacturers towelcome further purchases by us. If we do this \u2013 and if we can buy dealerships at sensible prices \u2013 we willbuild a business that before long will be multiples the size of Van Tuyl\u2019s $9 billion of sales.With the acquisition of Van Tuyl, Berkshire now owns 9\n1\u20442companies that would be listed on the Fortune 500 were they independent (Heinz is the\n1\u20442). That leaves 4901\u20442fish in the sea. Our lines are out.\n5\u2039Our subsidiaries spent a record $15 billion on plant and equipment during 2014, well over twice theirdepreciation charges. About 90% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we will alwaysinvest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunities runs through America. The treasures that have beenuncovered up to now are dwarfed by those still untapped. Through dumb luck, Charlie and I were born inthe United States, and we are forever grateful for the staggering advantages this accident of birth has givenus.\n\u2039Berkshire\u2019s yearend employees \u2013 including those at Heinz \u2013 totaled a record 340,499, up 9,754 from lastyear. The increase, I am proud to say, included no gain at headquarters (where 25 people work). No sensegoing crazy.\n\u2039Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its \u201cBig Four\u201d investments \u2013 AmericanExpress, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing ourownership to 7.8% versus 6.3% at yearend 2013). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola, AmericanExpress and Wells Fargo raised our percentage ownership of each. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from9.1% to 9.2%, our interest in American Express increased from 14.2% to 14.8% and our ownership ofWells Fargo grew from 9.2% to 9.4%. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren\u2019t important, ponder thismath: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one-tenth of a percent in our ownership raisesBerkshire\u2019s portion of their annual earnings by $50 million.These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented andshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of awonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It\u2019s better to have a partial interest in the HopeDiamond than to own all of a rhinestone.If Berkshire\u2019s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the \u201cBig Four\u2019s\u201d 2014 earningsbefore discontinued operations amounted to $4.7 billion (compared to $3.3 billion only three years ago). Inthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \u2013 about $1.6 billion lastyear. (Again, three years ago the dividends were $862 million.) But make no mistake: The $3.1 billion ofthese companies\u2019 earnings we don\u2019t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.The earnings these investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock \u2013 a move thatenhances Berkshire\u2019s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. Their retainedearnings also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us toexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time(though 2015 will be a tough year for the group, in part because of the strong dollar). If the expected gainsmaterialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capitalgains. (For the package of four, our unrealized gains already totaled $42 billion at yearend.)Our flexibility in capital allocation \u2013 our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlledbusinesses \u2013 gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they canoperate. Our appetite foreitheroperating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of findingsensible uses for Berkshire\u2019s endless gusher of cash.\n\u2039I\u2019ve mentioned in the past that my experience in business helps me as an investor and that my investmentexperience has made me a better businessman. Each pursuit teaches lessons that are applicable to the other.And some truths can only be fully learned through experience. (In Fred Schwed\u2019s wonderful book, Where Are the Customers\u2019 Yachts?, a Peter Arno cartoon depicts a puzzled Adam looking at an eager Eve, while acaption says, \u201cThere are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words orpictures.\u201d If you haven\u2019t read Schwed\u2019s book, buy a copy at our annual meeting. Its wisdom and humor aretruly priceless.)\n6Among Arno\u2019s \u201ccertain things,\u201d I would include two separate skills, the evaluation of investments and themanagement of businesses. I therefore think it\u2019s worthwhile for Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our twoinvestment managers, to each have oversight of at least one of our businesses. A sensible opportunity forthem to do so opened up a few months ago when we agreed to purchase two companies that, thoughsmaller than we would normally acquire, have excellent economic characteristics. Combined, the two earn$100 million annually on about $125 million of net tangible assets.I\u2019ve asked Todd and Ted to each take on one as Chairman, in which role they will function in the verylimited way that I do with our larger subsidiaries. This arrangement will save me a minor amount of workand, more important, make the two of them even better investors than they already are (which is to sayamong the best).************Late in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase inBerkshire\u2019s history. At the time, I called the transaction an \u201call-in wager on the economic future of the UnitedStates.\u201dThat kind of commitment was nothing new for us. We\u2019ve been making similar wagers ever since BuffettPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too: Charlie and I have always considered a\u201cbet\u201d on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.Indeed, who has ever benefited during the past 238 years by betting againstAmerica? If you compare our country\u2019s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. In my lifetime alone, real per-capita U.S. output hassextupled. My parents could not have dreamed in 1930 of the world their son would see.Though the preachers of pessimism prattle endlessly about America\u2019s problems, I\u2019ve never seen one who wishes toemigrate (though I can think of a few for whom I would happily buy a one-way ticket).The dynamism embedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. Gains won\u2019t come in asmooth or uninterrupted manner; they never have. And we will regularly grumble about our government. But, mostassuredly, America\u2019s best days lie ahead.With this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire\u2019s per-share intrinsic value by(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earningsthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shareswhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional largeacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for youby rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.Those building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and Berkshire HathawayEnergy will still be playing vital roles in our economy. Homes and autos will remain central to the lives of mostfamilies. Insurance will continue to be essential for both businesses and individuals. Looking ahead, Charlie and Isee a world made to order for Berkshire. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.Intrinsic Business ValueAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what thatnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out thethree elements \u2013 one of them qualitative \u2013 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\u2019s intrinsicvalue. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 123-124.Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2014 our per-share investments increased 8.4% to$140,123, and our earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 19% to $10,847 pershare.\n7Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19% compounded annually, and ourearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 44years has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in bothsectors, but our main focus is to build operating earnings. That\u2019s why we were pleased to exchange our Phillips 66and Graham Holdings stock for operating businesses last year and to contract with Procter and Gamble to acquireDuracell by means of a similar exchange set to close in 2015.************Now, let\u2019s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet andincome characteristics from the others. So we\u2019ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie andI view them (though there are important andenduringadvantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being thereporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don\u2019t get any ideas!)InsuranceLet\u2019s look first at insurance, Berkshire\u2019s core operation. That industry has been the engine that haspropelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &Marine, for $8.6 million. Though that purchase had monumental consequences for Berkshire, its execution wassimplicity itself.Jack Ringwalt, a friend of mine who was the controlling shareholder of the two companies, came to myoffice saying he would like to sell. Fifteen minutes later, we had a deal. Neither of Jack\u2019s companies had ever had anaudit by a public accounting firm, and I didn\u2019t ask for one. My reasoning: (1) Jack was honest and (2) He was also abit quirky and likely to walk away if the deal became at all complicated.On pages 128-129, we reproduce the 1\n1\u20442-page purchase agreement we used to finalize the transaction. That contract was homemade: Neither side used a lawyer. Per page, this has to be Berkshire\u2019s best deal: NationalIndemnity today has GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net worth of $111 billion, which exceeds thatof any other insurer in the world.One reason we were attracted to the property-casualty business was its financial characteristics: P/Cinsurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certainworkers\u2019 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later modelleaves P/C companies holding large sums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile,insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount offloat an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our businessgrows, so does our float. Andhowwe have grown, as the following table shows:Year\nFloat (in $ millions)\n1970 $ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322014 83,921Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and our new commercialinsurance operation are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, isparty to a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, itwill beverygradual \u2013 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such thatwe canneverbe subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. This strengthis a key pillar in Berkshire\u2019s economic fortress.8If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profitthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\u2013 and, better yet, getpaidfor holding it.Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, sovigorous indeed that it frequently causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of lowinterest rates our country is now dealing with causes earnings on float to decrease, thereby exacerbating the profitproblems of the industry.As noted in the first section of this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit fortwelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe wewill continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. That message isgiven at least lip service by all insurers; at Berkshire it is a religion.So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s bookvalue is calculated, thefullamount of our float is deducted as aliability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to thinkof float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claimsand related expenses \u2013 a huge $22.7 billion to more than six million claimants in 2014 \u2013 and that reduces float. Justas surely, we each day write new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float.If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of thisliability isdramaticallyless than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \u2013because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \u2013 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out thedoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities are treated as equals, however, under GAAP.A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \u201cgoodwill\u201d asset that we incurred in buyingour insurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paidfor the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has nobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of ourinsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay for float of similar qualitywere we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it \u2013 to befarin excess of its historic carrying value. Under present accounting rules (withwhich we agree) this excess value willneverbe entered on our books. But I can assure you that it\u2019s real. That\u2019s onereason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.************Berkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers runningdisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risksthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks thatare inappropriate in relation to our resources.\n9Indeed, we arefarmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if theinsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about triple anythingit has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of itsmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities in a marketthat might well have gone into shock. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers would be far in the red, if notfacing insolvency.Ajit\u2019s underwriting skills are unmatched. His mind, moreover, is an idea factory that is always lookingfor more lines of business he can add to his current assortment. Last year I told you about his formation of BerkshireHathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBHSI\u201d). This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantlywelcomed by both major insurance brokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. Previously, we hadwritten only a few specialized lines of commercial insurance.BHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insuranceworld. During 2014, Peter expanded his talented group, moving into both international business and new lines ofinsurance. We repeat last year\u2019s prediction that BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that will generatevolume in the billions within a few years.************We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actuallycausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after bothprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremium can\u2019t be obtained.Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back on businessthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\u201dspells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\u2019s hugefloat has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re\u2019s international life reinsurance business, which has grownconsistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that causedcommentators \u2013 and me as well, briefly \u2013 to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Reis now a gem.************Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 64 years ago. GEICO is managed by TonyNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 53 years of service in 2014. Tony became CEO in 1993, andsince then the company has been flying. There is nobetter manager than Tony.When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage thecompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICOwould succeed because itdeservedto succeed. No onelikesto buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes to drive. The insurance consequently needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \u2013 andonlya low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money byinsuring with GEICO. So stop reading and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.10GEICO\u2019s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year afteryear. (We ended 2014 at 10.8% compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control of GEICO.) Thecompany\u2019s low costs create a moat \u2013 anenduringone \u2013 that competitors are unable to cross. Our gecko never tires of telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. The gecko, I should add, has one particularlyendearing quality \u2013 he works without pay. Unlike a human spokesperson, he never gets a swelled head from hisfame nor does he have an agent to constantly remind us how valuable he is. I love the little guy.************In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of themplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation thatconsistently delivers an underwriting profit. Indeed, over the past decade, they have earned $2.95 billion fromunderwriting while growing their float from $1.7 billion to $8.6 billion. Charlie and I treasure these companies andtheir managers.

The \u201ccustomer\u201d pays money now; the insurer promises topay money in the future should certain unwanted events occur.Sometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by people in their20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay, even if economic chaos prevails whenpayment time arrives, is all-important.Berkshire\u2019s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by certain of the world\u2019s largest andmost sophisticated P/C insurers, who wished to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities.That is, these insurers wished to \u201ccede\u201d these liabilities \u2013 most of them potential losses from asbestos claims \u2013 to areinsurer. They needed the right one, though: If a reinsurer fails to pay a loss, the original insurer is still on the hookfor it. Choosing a reinsurer, therefore, that down the road proves to be financially strapped or a bad actor threatensthe original insurer with getting huge liabilities right back in its lap.Last year, our premier position in reinsurance was reaffirmed by our writing a policy carrying a $3 billionsingle premium. I believe that the policy\u2019s size has only been exceeded by our 2007 transaction with Lloyd\u2019s, inwhich the premium was $7.1 billion.In fact, I know of only eight P/C policies in history that had a single premium exceeding $1 billion. And,yes, all eight were written by Berkshire. Certain of these contracts will require us to make substantial payments 50years or more from now. When major insurers have needed an unquestionable promise that payments of this typewill be made, Berkshire has been the party \u2013 the onlyparty \u2013 to call.************Berkshire\u2019s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected bywide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.11Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesWe have two major operations, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d), that share importantcharacteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section inthis letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, withthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceedits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF\u2019s interest coverage was more than 8:1. (Our definition ofcoverage is pre-tax earnings/interest,notEBITDA/interest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\u2019s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering anessential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earningsstreams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Recently, we have furtherbroadened that base through our $3 billion (Canadian) acquisition of AltaLink, an electric transmission systemserving 85% of Alberta\u2019s population. This multitude of profit streams, supplemented by the inherent advantage ofbeing owned by a strong parent, has enabled BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt.This economic fact benefits both usandour customers.Every day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\u0081 BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of allinter-city freight, whether it is transported by truck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyoneelse, a fact establishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy\u2019s circulatory system.BNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentallyfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking onthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\u0081 BHE\u2019s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretches further. Inaddition, we are a leader in renewables: From a standing start ten years ago, BHE now accounts for 6% ofthe country\u2019s wind generation capacity and 7% of its solar generation capacity. Beyond these businesses,BHE owns two large pipelines that deliver 8% of our country\u2019s natural gas consumption; the recently-purchased electric transmission operation in Canada; and major electric businesses in the U.K. andPhilippines. And the beat goes on: We will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout theworld for decades to come.BHE can make these investments because it retains allof its earnings. In fact, last year the company retained more dollars of earnings \u2013 by far \u2013 than any other American electric utility. We and ourregulators see this 100% retention policy as an important advantage \u2013 one almost certain to distinguishBHE from other utilities for many years to come.When BHE completes certain renewables projects that are underway, the company\u2019s renewables portfoliowill have cost $15 billion. In addition, we have conventional projects in the works that will also cost many billions.We relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns \u2013 and, on that front, we put a largeamount of trust in future regulation.Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will foreverneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in ourself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people theyrepresent.12Last year we fully met this objective at BHE, just as we have in every year of our ownership. Our ratesremain low, our customer satisfaction is high and our record for employee safety is among the best in the industry.The story at BNSF, however \u2013 as I noted earlier \u2013 was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroaddisappointed many of its customers. This problem occurred despite the record capital expenditures that BNSF hasmade in recent years, with those having far exceeded the outlays made by Union Pacific, our principal competitor.The two railroads are of roughly equal size measured by revenues, though we carry considerably morefreight (measured either by carloads or ton-miles). But our service problems exceeded Union Pacific\u2019s last year, andwe lost market share as a result. Moreover, U.P.\u2019s earnings beat ours by a record amount. Clearly, we have a lot ofwork to do.We are wasting no time: As I also mentioned earlier, we will spend $6 billion in 2015 on improving ourrailroad\u2019s operation. That will amount to about 26% of estimated revenues (a calculation that serves as theindustry\u2019s yardstick). Outlays of this magnitude are largely unheard of among railroads. For us, this percentagecompares to our average of 18% in 2009-2013 and to U.P.\u2019s projection for the near future of 16-17%. Our hugeinvestments will soon lead to a system with greater capacity and much better service. Improved profits shouldfollow.Here are the key figures for Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF:Berkshire Hathaway Energy (89.9% owned)\nEarnings (in millions)\n2014 2013 2012\nU.K. utilities................................................................ $ 5 2 7 $ 3 6 2 $ 4 2 9Iowa utility................................................................. 2 9 8 2 3 0 2 3 6Nevada utilities............................................................. 5 4 9 \u2014 \u2014PacifiCorp (primarily Oregon and Utah).....................................1,010 982 737 Gas Pipelines (Northern Natural and Kern River) ............................ 3 7 9 3 8 5 3 8 3 HomeServices.............................................................. 1 3 9 1 3 9 8 2Other (net).................................................................. 2 3 6 4 9 1\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes .......................3,138 2,102 1,958 Interest..................................................................... 4 2 7 2 9 6 3 1 4Income taxes................................................................ 6 1 6 1 7 0 1 7 2\nNet earnings................................................................ $ 2,095 $ 1,636 $ 1,472\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire............................................ $ 1,882 $ 1,470 $ 1,323\nBNSF Earnings (in millions)\n2014 2013 2012\nRevenues................................................................... $23,239 $22,014 $20,835 Operating expenses......................................................... 16,237 15,357 14,835\nOperating earnings before interest and taxes.................................7,002 6,657 6,000 Interest (net)................................................................ 8 3 3 7 2 9 6 2 3Income taxes................................................................ 2,300 2,135 2,005\nNet earnings................................................................ $ 3,869 $ 3,793 $ 3,372\n13Manufacturing, Service and Retailing OperationsOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

In contrast, the operating expensefigures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certainintangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers moreaccurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAPfigures.I won\u2019t explain all of the adjustments \u2013 some are tiny and arcane \u2013 but serious investors should understandthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete over time, while others in no waylose value. For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. The concept of making charges againstother intangibles, such as the amortization of customer relationships, however, arises through purchase-accountingrules and clearly does not reflect reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges.Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated \u2013 even though from an investor\u2019s viewpointthey could not be more different.\n14In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 49, amortization charges of $1.15 billion have beendeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \u201creal,\u201d the rest not. The \u201cnon-real\u201d charges, once non-existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-realamortization charges will almost certainly rise further as we acquire more companies.\nThe GAAP-compliant table on page 67 gives you the current status of our intangible assets. We now have$7.4 billion left to amortize, of which $4.1 billion will be charged over the next five years. Eventually, of course,every dollar of non-real costs becomes entirely charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even iftrue earnings are flat.Depreciation charges, we want to emphasize, are different: Every dime of depreciation expense we reportis a real cost. That\u2019s true, moreover, at most other companies. When CEOs tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, wirethem up for a polygraph test.Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,you should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.************To get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, they sell products ranging fromlollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector\u2019s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangibleassets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate goodreturns in the area of 12% to 20%. A few, however, have very poor returns, the result of some serious mistakes Imade in my job of capital allocation. I was not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economicdynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates.Fortunately, my blunders normally involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generallyworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, nonetheless, made my last mistake in purchasingeither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an averageof $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2014 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and usinglittle leverage, earned 18.7% after-tax on that capital.Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought for too high a price. Wehave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the largefigure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed inthis sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value by a goodmargin, and that premium is likely to widen. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value inboth the insurance and regulated-industry segments is fargreater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.************We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, theircompetitors \u2013 both current and potential \u2013 read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged ifothers knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire,therefore, we only disclose what is required. You can find a good bit of detail about many of our operations,however, on pages 97-100.\n15Finance and Financial ProductsThis year we include in this section Marmon\u2019s very sizable leasing operations, whose wares are railcars,containers and cranes. We have also restated the previous two years to reflect that change. Why have we made it? Atone time there was a large minority ownership at Marmon, and I felt it was more understandable to include all of thecompany\u2019s operations in one place. Today we own virtually 100% of Marmon, which makes me think you will gainmore insight into our various businesses if we include Marmon\u2019s leasing operations under this heading. (The figuresfor the many dozens of Marmon\u2019s other businesses remain in the previous section.)Our other leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture) and XTRA (semi-trailers).These companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy hasgained strength. Both companies have invested more money in new equipment than have many of their competitors,and that\u2019s paying off.Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the largest homebuilder in America. Last year, Clayton sold 30,871 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes bought byAmericans. When we purchased Clayton in 2003 for $1.7 billion, its share was 14%.Key to Clayton\u2019s earnings is the company\u2019s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. During the financial panic of2008 and 2009, when funding for the industry dried up, Clayton was able to keep lending because of Berkshire\u2019sbacking. In fact, we continued during that period to finance our competitors\u2019 retail sales as well as our own.Many of Clayton\u2019s borrowers have low incomes and mediocre FICO scores. But thanks to the company\u2019ssensible lending practices, its portfolio performed well during the recession, meaning a very high percentage of ourborrowers kept their homes. Our blue-collar borrowers, in many cases, proved much better credit risks than theirhigher-income brethren.At Marmon\u2019s railroad-car operation, lease rates have improved substantially over the past few years. Thenature of this business, however, is that only 20% or so of our leases expire annually. Consequently, improvedpricing only gradually works its way into our revenue stream. The trend, though, is strong. Our 105,000-car fleetconsists largely of tank cars, but only 8% of those transport crude oil.One further fact about our rail operation is important for you to know: Unlike many other lessors, wemanufacture our own tank cars, about 6,000 of them in a good year. We do not book anyprofit when we transfer cars from our manufacturing division to our leasing division. Our fleet is consequently placed on our books at a\u201cbargain\u201d price. The difference between that figure and a \u201cretail\u201d price is only slowly reflected in our earningsthrough smaller annual depreciation charges that we enjoy over the 30-year life of the car. Because of that fact aswell as others, Marmon\u2019s rail fleet is worth considerably more than the $5 billion figure at which it is carried on ourbooks.Here\u2019s the earnings recap for this sector:2014\n2013 2012\n(in millions)\nBerkadia (our 50% share)............. $ 1 2 2 $ 8 0 $ 3 5Clayton............................... 5 5 8 4 1 6 2 5 5CORT................................ 3 6 4 0 4 2Marmon \u2013 Containers and Cranes..... 2 3 8 2 2 6 2 4 6Marmon \u2013 Railcars.................... 4 4 2 3 5 3 2 9 9XTRA................................ 1 4 7 1 2 5 1 0 6Net financial income*................. 2 9 6 3 2 4 4 1 0\n$ 1,839 $ 1,564 $ 1,393\n* Excludes capital gains or losses16InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. 12/31/14\nShares** CompanyPercentage ofCompany\nOwnedCost* Market(in millions) 151,610,700 American Express Company.................14.8 $ 1,287 $ 14,106 400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company.................... 9 . 21,299 16,888 18,513,482 DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. ............. 8 . 6 8 4 3 1,402 15,430,586 Deere & Company.......................... 4 . 5 1,253 1,365 24,617,939 DIRECTV.................................. 4 . 9 1,454 2,134 13,062,594 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ............. 3 . 0 7 5 0 2,532 76,971,817 International Business Machines Corp. ...... 7 . 813,157 12,349 24,669,778 Moody\u2019s Corporation........................12.1 248 2,364 20,060,390 Munich Re..................................11.8 2,990 4,023 52,477,678 The Procter & Gamble Company ............ 1 . 9 3 3 6 4,683 *** 22,169,930 Sanofi....................................... 1 . 7 1,721 2,032 96,890,665 U.S. Bancorp................................ 5 . 4 3,033 4,355 43,387,980 USG Corporation............................30.0 836 1,214 67,707,544 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc........................ 2 . 13,798 5,815 483,470,853 Wells Fargo & Company.................... 9 . 411,871 26,504 Others....................................... 10,180 15,704\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market....$55,056 $ 117,470\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP \u201ccost\u201d differs in a few cases because of write-ups orwrite-downs that have been required under GAAP rules.**Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.***Held under contract of sale for this amount.Berkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table: We can buy 700 million sharesof Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At yearend these shares were worth $12.5billion. We are likely to purchase the shares just before expiration of our option. In the meantime, it is important foryou to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth largest equity investment \u2013 and one we value highly.************Attentive readers will notice that Tesco, which last year appeared in the list of our largest common stockinvestments, is now absent. An attentiveinvestor, I\u2019m embarrassed to report, would have sold Tesco shares earlier. I made a big mistake with this investment by dawdling.At the end of 2012 we owned 415 million shares of Tesco, then and now the leading food retailer in theU.K. and an important grocer in other countries as well. Our cost for this investment was $2.3 billion, and themarket value was a similar amount.\n17In 2013, I soured somewhat on the company\u2019s then-management and sold 114 million shares, realizing aprofit of $43 million. My leisurely pace in making sales would prove expensive. Charlie calls this sort of behavior\u201cthumb-sucking.\u201d (Considering what my delay cost us, he is being kind.)During 2014, Tesco\u2019s problems worsened by the month. The company\u2019s market share fell, its marginscontracted and accounting problems surfaced. In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see acockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.We sold Tesco shares throughout the year and are now out of the position. (The company, we shouldmention, has hired new management, and we wish them well.) Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444million, about 1/5 of 1% of Berkshire\u2019s net worth. In the past 50 years, we have only once realized an investmentloss that at the time of sale cost us 2% of our net worth. Twice, we experienced 1% losses. All three of these lossesoccurred in the 1974-1975 period, when we sold stocks that were very cheap in order to buy others we believed tobe even cheaper.************Our investment results have been helped by a terrific tailwind. During the 1964-2014 period, the S&P 500\nrose from 84 to 2,059, which, with reinvested dividends, generated the overall return of 11,196% shown on page 2.Concurrently, the purchasing power of the dollar declined a staggering 87%. That decrease means that it now takes$1 to buy what could be bought for 13\u00a2 in 1965 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).There is an important message for investors in that disparate performance between stocks and dollars.Think back to our 2011 annual report, in which we defined investing as \u201cthe transfer to others of purchasing powernow with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power \u2013 after taxes have been paid on nominal gains\u2013 in the future.\u201dThe unconventional, but inescapable, conclusion to be drawn from the past fifty years is that it has been far safer to invest in a diversified collection of American businesses than to invest in securities \u2013 Treasuries, forexample \u2013 whose values have been tied to American currency. That was also true in the preceding half-century, aperiod including the Great Depression and two world wars. Investors should heed this history. To one degree oranother it is almost certain to be repeated during the next century.Stock prices will always be far morevolatilethan cash-equivalent holdings.Over the long term, however, currency-denominated instruments areriskierinvestments \u2013farriskier investments \u2013 than widely-diversified stock portfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions. Thatlesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy forrisk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is farfrom synonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.It is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal andpurchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors \u2013 say,investment banks \u2013 whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sellsecurities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near-term needs for fundsshould keep appropriate sums in Treasuries or insured bank deposits.For the great majority of investors, however, who can \u2013 and should\u2013 invest with a multi-decade horizon, quotational declines are unimportant. Their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasingpower over their investing lifetime. For them, a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time, will prove far less risky than dollar-based securities.\n18If the investor, instead, fears price volatility, erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk, he may,ironically, end up doing some very risky things. Recall, if you will, the pundits who six years ago bemoaned fallingstock prices and advised investing in \u201csafe\u201d Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded thissermon are now earning a pittance on sums they had previously expected would finance a pleasant retirement. (TheS&P 500 was then below 700; now it is about 2,100.) If not for their fear of meaningless price volatility, theseinvestors could have assured themselves of a good income for life by simply buying a very low-cost index fundwhose dividends would trend upward over the years and whose principal would grow as well (with many ups anddowns, to be sure).Investors, of course, can,by their own behavior, make stock ownership highly risky. And many do. Active trading, attempts to \u201ctime\u201d market movements, inadequate diversification, the payment of high and unnecessary feesto managers and advisors, and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life-long owner ofequities would otherwise enjoy. Indeed, borrowed money has noplace in the investor\u2019s tool kit:Anythingcan happenanytimein markets. And no advisor, economist, or TV commentator \u2013 and definitely not Charlie nor I \u2013 cantell you when chaos will occur. Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet.The commission of the investment sins listed above is not limited to \u201cthe little guy.\u201d Huge institutionalinvestors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index-fund investor who simply sitstight for decades. A major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn,recommend high-fee managers. And that is a fool\u2019s game.There are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good \u2013 though in the short run, it\u2019s difficultto determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating highfees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen totheir siren songs, investors \u2013 large and small \u2013 should instead read Jack Bogle\u2019s The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.Decades ago, Ben Graham pinpointed the blame for investment failure, using a quote from Shakespeare:\u201cThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.\u201dThe Annual MeetingThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 2\nndat the CenturyLink Center. Last year\u2019s attendance of 39,000 set a record, and we expect a further increase this year as we celebrate our Golden Anniversary. Be therewhen the doors open at 7 a.m.Berkshire\u2019s talented Carrie Sova will again be in charge. Carrie joined us six years ago at the age of 24 asa secretary. Then, four years ago, I asked her to take charge of the meeting \u2013 a huge undertaking, requiring amultitude of skills \u2013 and she jumped at the chance. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out thebest in the hundreds who work with her. She is aided by our entire home office crew who enjoy pitching in to makethe weekend fun and informative for our owners.And, yes, we also try to sell our visiting shareholders our products while they\u2019re here. In fact, this yearwe will substantially increase the hours available for purchases, opening for business at the CenturyLink on Friday,May 1\nst, from noon to 5 p.m. as well as the usual 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on meeting day. So bring a smile to Charlie\u2019s faceand do some serious shopping.Get up early on Saturday morning. At 6:20 a.m., Norman and Jake, two Texas longhorns each weighingabout a ton, will proceed down 10\nthStreet to the CenturyLink. Aboard them will be a couple of our Justin Bootexecutives, who do double duty as cowboys. Following the steers will be four horses pulling a Wells Fargostagecoach. Berkshire already markets planes, trains and automobiles. Adding steers and stagecoaches to ourportfolio should seal our reputation as America\u2019s all-purpose transportation company.\n19At about 7:30 a.m. on Saturday, we will have our fourth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Ourtarget again will be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager\u2013 in my one brief flirtation with honest labor \u2013 I tossed about 500,000 papers. So I think I\u2019m pretty good. Challengeme! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! I\u2019ll buy a Dilly Bar for anyone who lands his or her throw closer to thedoorstep than I do. The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).I\u2019ll present a special prize to the 12-or-under contestant who makes the best toss. Deb Bosanek will be the judge.At 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answerperiod, which (with a break for lunch at CenturyLink\u2019s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess, Charlieand I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour or so.Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in whichproducts from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale. If you don\u2019t get your shopping done on Friday, slipout while Charlie\u2019s talking on Saturday and binge on our bargains. Check the terrific BNSF railroad layout also.Even though I\u2019m 84, it still excites me.Last year you did your part as a shopper, and most of our businesses racked up record sales. In a nine-hourperiod on Saturday, we sold 1,385 pairs of Justin boots (that\u2019s a pair every 23 seconds), 13,440 pounds of See\u2019scandy, 7,276 pairs of Wells Lamont work gloves and 10,000 bottles of Heinz ketchup. Heinz has a new mustardproduct, so both mustard and ketchup will be available this year. (Buy both!) Now that we are open for business onFriday as well, we expect new records in every precinct.Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at themeeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them the next day at our third annual \u201cBerkshire 5K,\u201d an 8 a.m. racestarting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor\u2019s Guide that will be sent toyou with your credentials for the meeting. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many ofBerkshire\u2019s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in.)A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company\u2019s top counselors fromaround the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount(usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplementalpoint: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.)Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of newtitles. Last year, many shareholders purchased Max Olson\u2019s compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965,and he has produced an updated edition for the meeting. We also expect to be selling an inexpensive bookcommemorating our fifty years. It\u2019s currently a work in process, but I expect it to contain a wide variety of historicalmaterial, including documents from the 19\nthCentury.An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked upprices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1\u20442hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to$1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72\nndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having \u201cBerkshire Weekend\u201d discount pricing. Last year in the week surrounding the meeting, the store dida record $40,481,817 of business. (An average week for NFM\u2019s Omaha store is about $9 million.)\n20To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 28th\nand Monday, May 4thinclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period\u2019s special pricing will evenapply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting butwhich, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation.NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 1\nst. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 3rd, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded our salesin all of December, normally a jeweler\u2019s best month.We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 27\nththrough Saturday, May 9th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows youare a Berkshire holder.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, willbewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world\u2019s top bridgeexperts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Don\u2019t play them for money.My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I metAriel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she\u2019s a sophomore atPrinceton, having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don\u2019t mind embarrassingyourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.Gorat\u2019s and Piccolo\u2019s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 3\nrd. Both will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat\u2019s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo\u2019s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurantsare my favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat\u2019s,call 402-551-3733 on April 1\nst(but not before); for Piccolo\u2019s, call 402-346-2865. At Piccolo\u2019s, order a giant rootbeer float for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at themeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists andtheir e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, who retired last year after sixty years at Fortune, but remains theexpert on business and financial matters, and who may be e-mailed at loomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, atBerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the mostinteresting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if youkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than twoquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your namementioned if your question is asked.)We will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist willbe Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come fromJonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Our hope is that the analysts andjournalists will ask questions that add to our owners\u2019 understanding and knowledge of their investment.\n21Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,for sure, and that\u2019s the way we like it. All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from eachanalyst and journalist and for 18 from the audience. (Last year we had 62 in total.) The questioners from theaudience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annualmeeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, adrawing.While I\u2019m on the subject of our owners\u2019 gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believeall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and should also haveadequate time to analyze it. That\u2019s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and whyour annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors oranalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. ************We get terrific help at meeting time from literally thousands of Omaha residents and businesses whowant you to enjoy yourselves. This year, because we expect record attendance, we have worried about a shortage ofhotel rooms. To deal with that possible problem, Airbnb is making a special effort to obtain listings for the periodaround meeting time and is likely to have a wide array of accommodations to offer. Airbnb\u2019s services may beespecially helpful to shareholders who expect to spend only a single night in Omaha and are aware that last year afew hotels required guests to pay for a minimum of three nights. That gets expensive. Those people on a tightbudget should check the Airbnb website. ************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of ourmanagers also to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies.Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business \u201chome runs\u201d means as much tothem as their paycheck.Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. Thisgroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 24,100-page Federalincome tax return and oversees the filing of 3,400 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and mediainquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country\u2019s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\u2019sactivities \u2013 and the list goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handleall kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered inHeinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.Last year, for the annual report, we dropped our 48-year-old \u201cno pictures\u201d policy \u2013 who says I\u2019m notflexible? \u2013 and ran a photo of our remarkable home-office crew that was taken at our Christmas lunch. I didn\u2019t warnthe gang of the public exposure they were to receive, so they didn\u2019t have on their Sunday best. This year was adifferent story: On the facing page you will see what our group looks like when they think someone will be noticing.However they dress, their performance is mind-boggling.Come meet them on May 2\nndand enjoy our Woodstock for Capitalists.February 27, 2015 Warren E. BuffettChairman of the Board22BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.ACQUISITION CRITERIAWe are eager to hearfrom principals or their representativesabout businesses that meet all of the following criteria: (1) Large purchases (at least $75 million of pre-tax earnings unless the business will fit into one of our existing units),(2) Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections are of no interest to us, nor are \u201cturnaround\u201d situations),(3) Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt,(4) Management in place (we can\u2019t supply it),(5) Simple businesses (if there\u2019s lots of technology, we won\u2019t understand it),(6) An offering price (we don\u2019t want to waste our time or that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily, about a transactionwhen price is unknown).The larger the company, the greater will be our interest: We would like to make an acquisition in the $5-20 billion range. We are not interested, however, in receiving suggestions about purchases we might make in the general stock market.We will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise complete confidentiality and a very fast answer \u2013 customarilywithin five minutes \u2013 as to whether we\u2019re interested. We prefer to buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when we receive asmuch in intrinsic business value as we give.We don\u2019t participate in auctions. Charlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions that don\u2019t come close to meeting our tests: We\u2019ve found that if youadvertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will call hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels. A line from a country songexpresses our feeling about new ventures, turnarounds, or auction-like sales: \u201cWhen the phone don\u2019t ring, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s me.\u201d\n23Berkshire \u2013 Past, Present and FutureIn the BeginningOn May 6, 1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter to itsshareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had expected the letter; I wassurprised by the price.Berkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett PartnershipLtd. (\u201cBPL\u201d), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net worth. Shortly before thetender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I answered $11.50, and hesaid, \u201cFine, we have a deal.\u201d Then came Berkshire\u2019s letter, offering an eighth of a point less. I bristled at Stanton\u2019sbehavior and didn\u2019t tender.That was a monumentally stupid decision.Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which itoperated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically. And Berkshire, for a variety of reasons, was unableto change course.That was true even though the industry\u2019s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire\u2019s ownBoard minutes of July 29, 1954, laid out the grim facts: \u201cThe textile industry in New England started going out ofbusiness forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply anddemand have been balanced.\u201dAbout a year after that board meeting, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing \u2013both with roots in the 19\nthCentury \u2013 joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managementsviewed as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following theconsolidation, Berkshire operated at an overall loss, and its net worth shrunk by 37%.Meanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchaseshares. And that pattern caught my attention.I purchased BPL\u2019s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and morerepurchases. The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 andbook value of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puffremaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasurewas enjoyed, however, no more could be expected.Berkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, setout to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of ouroriginal purchases. There it was \u2013 my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for otherdiscarded butts.Instead, irritated by Stanton\u2019s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshireshares.\n24By April 1965, BPL owned 392,633 shares (out of 1,017,547 then outstanding) and at an early-May boardmeeting we formally took control of the company. Through Seabury\u2019s and my childish behavior \u2013 after all, whatwas an eighth of a point to either of us? \u2013 he lost his job, and I found myself with more than 25% of BPL\u2019s capitalinvested in a terrible business about which I knew very little. I became the dog who caught the car.Because of Berkshire\u2019s operating losses and share repurchases, its net worth at the end of fiscal 1964 hadfallen to $22 million from $55 million at the time of the 1955 merger. The full $22 million was required by thetextile operation: The company had no excess cash and owed its bank $2.5 million. (Berkshire\u2019s 1964 annual reportis reproduced on pages 130-142.)For a time I got lucky: Berkshire immediately enjoyed two years of good operating conditions. Better yet,its earnings in those years were free of income tax because it possessed a large loss carry-forward that had arisenfrom the disastrous results in earlier years.Then the honeymoon ended. During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with thetextile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness \u2013 stupidity? \u2013 has its limits. In 1985, I finally threw in the toweland closed the operation. ************Undeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL\u2019s resources to a dying business, I quicklycompounded the error. Indeed, my second blunder was far more serious than the first, eventually becoming the mostcostly in my career.Early in 1967, I had Berkshire pay $8.6 million to buy National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), a small butpromising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company was also included in the deal.) Insurance was in my sweetspot: I understood and liked the industry.Jack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me \u2013 me, personally. Inno way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I\u2019vehad 48 years to think about that question, and I\u2019ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossalmistake.If BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I would have owned 100% of a fine business, destined toform the base for building the company Berkshire has become. Moreover, our growth would not have been impededfor nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation. Finally, our subsequentacquisitions would have been owned in their entirety by my partners and me rather than being 39%-owned by thelegacy shareholders of Berkshire, to whom we had no obligation. Despite these facts staring me in the face, I optedto marry 100% of an excellent business (NICO) to a 61%-owned terrible business (Berkshire Hathaway), a decisionthat eventually diverted $100 billion or so from BPL partners to a collection of strangers. ************One more confession and then I\u2019ll go on to more pleasant topics: Can you believe that in 1975 I boughtWaumbec Mills, another New England textile company? Of course, the purchase price was a \u201cbargain\u201d based on theassets we received and theprojectedsynergies with Berkshire\u2019s existing textile business. Nevertheless \u2013 surprise,surprise \u2013 Waumbec was a disaster, with the mill having to be closed down not many years later.And now some good news: The northern textile industry is finally extinct. You need no longer panic if youhear that I\u2019ve been spotted wandering around New England.\n25Charlie Straightens Me OutMy cigar-butt strategy worked very well while I was managing small sums. Indeed, the many dozens offree puffs I obtained in the 1950s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absoluteinvestment performance.Even then, however, I made a few exceptions to cigar butts, the most important being GEICO. Thanks to a1951 conversation I had with Lorimer Davidson, a wonderful man who later became CEO of the company, I learnedthat GEICO was a terrific business and promptly put 65% of my $9,800 net worth into its shares. Most of my gainsin those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. BenGraham had taught me that technique, and it worked.But a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable onlyto a point. With large sums, it would never work well.In addition, though marginal businesses purchased at cheap prices may be attractive as short-terminvestments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriagepartner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating. (Berkshire, it should be noted, would have been ahighly satisfactory \u201cdate\u201d: If we had taken Seabury Stanton\u2019s $11.375 offer for our shares, BPL\u2019s weighted annualreturn on its Berkshire investment would have been about 40%.) ************It took Charlie Munger to break my cigar-butt habits and set the course for building a business that couldcombine huge size with satisfactory profits. Charlie had grown up a few hundred feet from where I now live and asa youth had worked, as did I, in my grandfather\u2019s grocery store. Nevertheless, it was 1959 before I met Charlie, longafter he had left Omaha to make Los Angeles his home. I was then 28 and he was 35. The Omaha doctor whointroduced us predicted that we would hit it off \u2013 and we did.If you\u2019ve attended our annual meetings, you know Charlie has a wide-ranging brilliance, a prodigiousmemory, and some firm opinions. I\u2019m not exactly wishy-washy myself, and we sometimes don\u2019t agree. In 56 years,however, we\u2019ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: \u201cWarren,think it over and you\u2019ll agree with me because you\u2019re smart and I\u2019m right.\u201dWhat most of you donotknow about Charlie is that architecture is among his passions. Though he beganhis career as a practicing lawyer (with his time billed at $15 per hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30sby designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that helives in today \u2013 some 55 years later. (Like me, Charlie can\u2019t be budged if he is happy in his surroundings.) In recentyears, Charlie has designed large dorm complexes at Stanford and the University of Michigan and today, at age 91,is working on another major project.From my perspective, though, Charlie\u2019s most important architectural feat was the design of today\u2019sBerkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderfulprices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.\n26Altering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success withoutCharlie\u2019s input, so why should I listen to a lawyer who had never spent a day in business school (when \u2013 ahem \u2013 I had attendedthree). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and hislogic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie\u2019s blueprint. My role has been that of generalcontractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire\u2019s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.The year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part \u2013remember my 1975 purchase of Waumbec). We had the opportunity then to buy See\u2019s Candy for Blue Chip Stamps,a company in which Charlie, I and Berkshire had major stakes, and which was later merged into Berkshire.See\u2019s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earningabout $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a hugeasset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significantpricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See\u2019s major gains in earnings over time. Better yet, thesewould materialize with only minor amounts of incremental investment. In other words, See\u2019s could be expected togush cash for decades to come.The family controlling See\u2019s wanted $30 million for the business, and Charlie rightly said it was worth thatmuch. But I didn\u2019t want to pay more than $25 million and wasn\u2019t all that enthusiastic even at that figure. (A pricethat was three times net tangible assets made me gulp.) My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrificpurchase. But, luckily, the sellers decided to take our $25 million bid.To date, See\u2019s has earned $1.9 billion pre-tax, with its growth having required added investment of only$40 million. See\u2019s has thus been able to distribute huge sums that have helped Berkshire buy other businesses that,in turn, have themselves produced large distributable profits. (Envision rabbits breeding.) Additionally, throughwatching See\u2019s in action, I gained a business education about the value of powerful brands that opened my eyes tomany other profitable investments. ************Even with Charlie\u2019s blueprint, I have made plenty of mistakes since Waumbec. The most gruesome wasDexter Shoe. When we purchased the company in 1993, it had a terrific record and in no way looked to me like acigar butt. Its competitive strengths, however, were soon to evaporate because of foreign competition. And I simplydidn\u2019t see that coming.Consequently, Berkshire paid $433 million for Dexter and, rather promptly, its value went to zero. GAAPaccounting, however, doesn\u2019t come close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshirestock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7billion. As a financial disaster, this one deserves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.Several of my subsequent errors also involved the use of Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whoseearnings were destined to simply limp along. Mistakes of that kind are deadly. Trading shares of a wonderfulbusiness \u2013 which Berkshire most certainly is \u2013 for ownership of a so-so business irreparably destroys value.We\u2019ve also suffered financially when this mistake has been committed by companies whose sharesBerkshire has owned (with the errors sometimes occurring while I was serving as a director). Too often CEOs seemblind to an elementary reality: The intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must not be greater thanthe intrinsic value of the business you receive.\n27I\u2019ve yet to see an investment banker quantify this all-important math when he is presenting a stock-for-stock deal to the board of a potential acquirer. Instead, the banker\u2019s focus will be on describing \u201ccustomary\u201dpremiums-to-market-price that are currently being paid for acquisitions \u2013 an absolutely asinine way to evaluate theattractiveness of an acquisition \u2013 or whether the deal will increase the acquirer\u2019s earnings-per-share (which in itselfshould be far from determinative). In striving to achieve the desired per-share number, a panting CEO and his\u201chelpers\u201d will often conjure up fanciful \u201csynergies.\u201d (As a director of 19 companies over the years, I\u2019ve never heard\u201cdis-synergies\u201d mentioned, though I\u2019ve witnessed plenty of these once deals have closed.) Post mortems ofacquisitions, in which reality is honestly compared to the original projections, are rare in American boardrooms.They should instead be standard practice.I can promise you that long after I\u2019m gone, Berkshire\u2019s CEO and Board will carefully make intrinsic valuecalculations before issuing shares in any acquisitions. You can\u2019t get rich trading a hundred-dollar bill for eight tens(even if your advisor has handed you an expensive \u201cfairness\u201d opinion endorsing that swap). ************Overall, Berkshire\u2019s acquisitions have worked out well \u2013 and verywell in the case of a few large ones. So, too, have our investments in marketable securities. The latter are always valued on our balance sheet at their marketprices so any gains \u2013 including those unrealized \u2013 are immediately reflected in our net worth. But the businesses webuy outright are never revalued upward on our balance sheet, even when we could sell them for many billions ofdollars more than their carrying value. The unrecorded gains in the value of Berkshire\u2019s subsidiaries have becomehuge, with these growing at a particularly fast pace in the last decade.Listening to Charlie has paid off.\n28Berkshire TodayBerkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further.Conglomerates, it should be acknowledged, have a terrible reputation with investors. And they richlydeserve it. Let me first explain why they are in the doghouse, and then I will go on to describe why theconglomerate form brings huge and enduring advantages to Berkshire.Since I entered the business world, conglomerates have enjoyed several periods of extreme popularity, thesilliest of which occurred in the late 1960s. The drill for conglomerate CEOs then was simple: By personality,promotion or dubious accounting \u2013 and often by all three \u2013 these managers drove a fledgling conglomerate\u2019s stockto, say, 20 times earnings and then issued shares as fast as possible to acquire another business selling at ten-or-sotimes earnings. They immediately applied \u201cpooling\u201d accounting to the acquisition, which \u2013 with not a dime\u2019s worthof change in the underlying businesses \u2013 automatically increased per-share earnings, and used the rise as proof ofmanagerial genius. They next explained to investors that this sort of talent justified the maintenance, or even theenhancement, of the acquirer\u2019s p/e multiple. And, finally, they promised to endlessly repeat this procedure andthereby create ever-increasing per-share earnings.Wall Street\u2019s love affair with this hocus-pocus intensified as the 1960s rolled by. The Street\u2019s denizens arealways ready to suspend disbelief when dubious maneuvers are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings,particularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willinglysprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates\u2019 accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how tofurther juice the numbers. For many, gushers of easy money washed away ethical sensitivities.Since the per-share earnings gains of an expanding conglomerate came from exploiting p/e differences, itsCEO had to search for businesses selling at low multiples of earnings. These, of course, were characteristicallymediocre businesses with poor long-term prospects. This incentive to bottom-fish usually led to a conglomerate\u2019scollection of underlying businesses becoming more and more junky. That mattered little to investors: It was dealvelocity and pooling accounting they looked to for increased earnings.The resulting firestorm of merger activity was fanned by an adoring press. Companies such as ITT, LittonIndustries, Gulf & Western, and LTV were lionized, and their CEOs became celebrities. (These once-famousconglomerates are now long gone. As Yogi Berra said, \u201cEvery Napoleon meets his Watergate.\u201d)Back then, accounting shenanigans of all sorts \u2013 many of them ridiculously transparent \u2013 were excused oroverlooked. Indeed, having an accounting wizard at the helm of an expanding conglomerate was viewed as a hugeplus: Shareholders in those instances could be sure that reportedearnings would never disappoint, no matter how bad the operating realities of the business might become.In the late 1960s, I attended a meeting at which an acquisitive CEO bragged of his \u201cbold, imaginativeaccounting.\u201d Most of the analysts listening responded with approving nods, seeing themselves as having found amanager whose forecasts were certain to be met, whatever the business results might be.\n29Eventually, however, the clock struck twelve, and everything turned to pumpkins and mice. Once again, itbecame evident that business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares \u2013 just like chain-lettermodels \u2013 most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. Both phenomena, nevertheless, periodicallyblossom in our country \u2013 they are every promoter\u2019s dream \u2013 though often they appear in a carefully-crafted disguise.The ending is always the same: Money flows from the gullible to the fraudster. And with stocks, unlike chain letters,the sums hijacked can be staggering.At both BPL and Berkshire, we haveneverinvested in companies that are hell-bent on issuing shares. That behavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotion-minded management, weak accounting, a stock that isoverpriced and \u2013 all too often \u2013 outright dishonesty. ************So what do Charlie and I find so attractive about Berkshire\u2019s conglomerate structure? To put the casesimply: If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capitalgrowth.One of the heralded virtues of capitalism is that it efficiently allocates funds. The argument is that marketswill direct investment to promising businesses and deny it to those destined to wither. That is true: With all itsexcesses, market-driven allocation of capital is usually far superior to any alternative.Nevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital. As those 1954 Berkshireminutes made clear, capital withdrawals within the textile industry that should have been obvious were delayed fordecades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements. Indeed, I myself delayed abandoning ourobsolete textile mills for far too long.A CEO with capital employed in a declining operation seldom elects to massively redeploy that capital intounrelated activities. A move of that kind would usually require that long-time associates be fired and mistakes beadmitted. Moreover, it\u2019s unlikelythatCEO would be the manager you would wish to handle the redeployment jobeven if he or she was inclined to undertake it.At the shareholder level, taxes and frictional costs weigh heavily on individual investors when they attemptto reallocate capital among businesses and industries. Even tax-free institutional investors face major costs as theymove capital because they usually need intermediaries to do this job. A lot of mouths with expensive tastes thenclamor to be fed \u2013 among them investment bankers, accountants, consultants, lawyers and such capital-reallocatorsas leveraged buyout operators. Money-shufflers don\u2019t come cheap.In contrast, a conglomerate such as Berkshire is perfectly positioned to allocate capital rationally and atminimal cost. Of course, form itself is no guarantee of success: We have made plenty of mistakes, and we will makemore. Our structural advantages, however, are formidable.At Berkshire, we can \u2013 without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs \u2013 move huge sums frombusinesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise.Moreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject topressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That\u2019s important: If horses hadcontrolled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.\n30Another major advantage we possess is the ability to buy piecesof wonderful businesses \u2013 a.k.a. common stocks. That\u2019s not a course of action open to most managements. Over our history, this strategic alternative hasproved to be very helpful; a broad range of options always sharpens decision-making. The businesses we are offeredby the stock market every day \u2013 in small pieces, to be sure \u2013 are often far more attractive than the businesses we areconcurrently being offered in their entirety. Additionally, the gains we\u2019ve realized from marketable securities havehelped us make certain large acquisitions that would otherwise have been beyond our financial capabilities.In effect, the world is Berkshire\u2019s oyster \u2013 a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond thoserealistically open to most companies. We are limited, of course, to businesses whose economic prospects we canevaluate. And that\u2019s a serious limitation: Charlie and I have no idea what a great many companies will look like tenyears from now. But that limitation is much smaller than that borne by an executive whose experience has beenconfined to a single industry. On top of that, we can profitably scale to a farlarger size than the many businesses that are constrained by the limited potential of the single industry in which they operate.I mentioned earlier that See\u2019s Candy had produced huge earnings compared to its modest capitalrequirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. Butour many attempts to do so were largely futile. So, without incurring tax inefficiencies or frictional costs, we haveused the excess funds generated by See\u2019s to help purchase other businesses. If See\u2019s had remained a stand-alonecompany, its earnings would have had to be distributed to investors to redeploy, sometimes after being heavilydepleted by large taxes and, almost always, by significant frictional and agency costs. ************Berkshire has one further advantage that has become increasingly important over the years: We are now thehome of choice for the owners and managers of many outstanding businesses.Families that own successful businesses have multiple options when they contemplate sale. Frequently, thebest decision is to do nothing. There are worse things in life than having a prosperous business that one understandswell. But sitting tight is seldom recommended by Wall Street. (Don\u2019t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.)When one part of a family wishes to sell while others wish to continue, a public offering often makessense. But, when owners wish to cash out entirely, they usually consider one of two paths.The first is sale to a competitor who is salivating at the possibility of wringing \u201csynergies\u201d from thecombining of the two companies. This buyer invariably contemplates getting rid of large numbers of the seller\u2019sassociates, the very people who have helped the owner build his business. A caring owner, however \u2013 and there areplenty of them \u2013 usually does not want to leave his long-time associates sadly singing the old country song: \u201c She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.\u201dThe second choice for sellers is the Wall Street buyer. For some years, these purchasers accurately calledthemselves \u201cleveraged buyout firms.\u201d When that term got a bad name in the early 1990s \u2013 remember RJR andBarbarians at the Gate? \u2013 these buyers hastily relabeled themselves \u201cprivate-equity.\u201dThe name may have changed but that was all: Equity is dramatically reducedand debt is piled on in virtually all private-equity purchases. Indeed, the amount that a private-equity purchaser offers to the seller is in partdetermined by the buyer assessing themaximumamount of debt that can be placed on the acquired company.\n31Later, if things go well and equity begins to build, leveraged buy-out shops will often seek to re-leveragewith new borrowings. They then typically use part of the proceeds to pay a huge dividend that drives equity sharplydownward, sometimes even to a negative figure.In truth, \u201cequity\u201d is a dirty word for many private-equity buyers; what they love is debt. And, because debtis currently so inexpensive, these buyers can frequently pay top dollar. Later, the business will be resold, often toanother leveraged buyer. In effect, the business becomes a piece of merchandise.Berkshire offers a third choice to the business owner who wishes to sell: a permanent home, in which thecompany\u2019s people and culture will be retained (though, occasionally, management changes will be needed). Beyondthat, any business we acquire dramatically increases its financial strength and ability to grow. Its days of dealingwith banks and Wall Street analysts are also forever ended.Some sellers don\u2019t care about these matters. But, when sellers do, Berkshire does not have a lot ofcompetition. ************Sometimes pundits propose that Berkshire spin-off certain of its businesses. These suggestions make nosense. Our companies are worth more as part of Berkshire than as separate entities. One reason is our ability tomove funds between businesses or into new ventures instantly and without tax. In addition, certain costs duplicatethemselves, in full or part, if operations are separated. Here\u2019s the most obvious example: Berkshire incurs nominalcosts for its single board of directors; were our dozens of subsidiaries to be split off, the overall cost for directorswould soar. So, too, would regulatory and administration expenditures.Finally, there are sometimes important tax efficiencies for Subsidiary A because we own Subsidiary B. Forexample, certain tax credits that are available to our utilities are currently realizable only because we generate hugeamounts of taxable income at other Berkshire operations. That gives Berkshire Hathaway Energy a major advantageover most public-utility companies in developing wind and solar projects.Investment bankers, being paid as they are for action, constantly urge acquirers to pay 20% to 50%premiums over market price for publicly-held businesses. The bankers tell the buyer that the premium is justified for\u201ccontrol value\u201d and for the wonderful things that are going to happen once the acquirer\u2019s CEO takes charge. (Whatacquisition-hungry manager will challengethatassertion?)A few years later, bankers \u2013 bearing straight faces \u2013 again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off theearlier acquisition in order to \u201cunlock shareholder value.\u201d Spin-offs, of course, strip the owning company of itspurported \u201ccontrol value\u201d without any compensating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company willflourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracyof the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.)If the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again beurged by its bankers to pay a hefty \u201ccontrol\u201d premium for the privilege. (Mental \u201cflexibility\u201d of this sort by thebanking fraternity has prompted the saying that fees too often lead to transactions rather than transactions leading tofees.)It\u2019s possible, of course, that someday a spin-off or sale at Berkshire would be required by regulators.Berkshire carried out such a spin-off in 1979, when new regulations for bank holding companies forced us to divesta bank we owned in Rockford, Illinois.\n32Voluntary spin-offs, though, make no sense for us: We would lose control value, capital-allocationflexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages. The CEOs who brilliantly run our subsidiaries now wouldhave difficulty in being as effective if running a spun-off operation, given the operating and financial advantagesderived from Berkshire\u2019s ownership. Moreover, the parent and the spun-off operations, once separated, would likelyincur moderately greater costs than existed when they were combined. ************Before I depart the subject of spin-offs, let\u2019s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentionedearlier: LTV. I\u2019ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about JimmyLing that ran in the October 1982 issue ofD Magazine. Look it up on the Internet.Through a lot of corporate razzle-dazzle, Ling had taken LTV from sales of only $36 million in 1965 tonumber 14 on the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerialskills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. And Ling had nopeer in that respect.Ling\u2019s strategy, which he labeled \u201cproject redeployment,\u201d was to buy a large company and then partiallyspin off its various divisions. In LTV\u2019s 1966 annual report, he explained the magic that would follow: \u201cMostimportantly, acquisitions must meet the test of the 2 plus 2 equals 5 (or 6) formula.\u201d The press, the public and WallStreet loved this sort of talk.In 1967 Ling bought Wilson & Co., a huge meatpacker that also had interests in golf equipment andpharmaceuticals. Soon after, he split the parent into three businesses, Wilson & Co. (meatpacking), Wilson SportingGoods and Wilson Pharmaceuticals, each of which was to be partially spun off. These companies quickly becameknown on Wall Street as Meatball, Golf Ball and Goof Ball.Soon thereafter, it became clear that, like Icarus, Ling had flown too close to the sun. By the early 1970s,Ling\u2019s empire was melting, and he himself had been spun off from LTV . . . that is,fired. Periodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality \u2013 you can count on that. More JimmyLings will appear. They will look and sound authoritative. The press will hang on their every word. Bankers willfight for their business. What they are saying will recently have \u201cworked.\u201d Their early followers will be feeling veryclever. Our suggestion: Whatever their line, never forget that 2+2 will always equal 4. And when someone tells youhow old-fashioned that math is --- zip up your wallet, take a vacation and come back in a few years to buy stocks atcheap prices. ************Today Berkshire possesses (1) an unmatched collection of businesses, most of them now enjoyingfavorable economic prospects; (2) a cadre of outstanding managers who, with few exceptions, are unusually devotedto both the subsidiary they operateandto Berkshire; (3) an extraordinary diversity of earnings, premier financialstrength and oceans of liquidity that we will maintain under allcircumstances; (4) a first-choice ranking among many owners and managers who are contemplating sale of their businesses and (5) in a point related to thepreceding item, a culture, distinctive in many ways from that of most large companies, that we have worked 50years to develop and that is now rock-solid.These strengths provide us a wonderful foundation on which to build.\n33The Next 50 Years at BerkshireNow let\u2019s take a look at the road ahead. Bear in mind that if I had attempted 50 years ago to gauge whatwas coming, certain of my predictions would have been far off the mark. With that warning, I will tell you what Iwould say to my family today if they asked me about Berkshire\u2019s future.\n\u2039First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshireshareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments. That\u2019s because our per-shareintrinsic business valueis almost certain to advance over time.This cheery prediction comes, however, with an important caution: If an investor\u2019s entry point intoBerkshire stock is unusually high \u2013 at a price, say, approaching double book value, which Berkshire shareshave occasionally reached \u2013 it may well be many years before the investor can realize a profit. In otherwords, a sound investment can morph into a rash speculation if it is bought at an elevated price. Berkshireis not exempt from this truth.Purchases of Berkshire that investors make at a price modestly above the level at which the companywould repurchase its shares, however, should produce gains within a reasonable period of time. Berkshire\u2019sdirectors will only authorize repurchases at a price they believe to be well belowintrinsic value. (In our view, that is an essential criterion for repurchases that is often ignored by other managements.)For those investors who plan to sell within a year or two after their purchase, I can offer noassurances, whatever the entry price. Movements of the general stock market during such abbreviated periods willlikely be far more important in determining your results than the concomitant change in the intrinsic valueof your Berkshire shares. As Ben Graham said many decades ago: \u201cIn the short-term the market is a votingmachine; in the long-run it acts as a weighing machine.\u201d Occasionally, the voting decisions of investors \u2013amateurs and professionals alike \u2013 border on lunacy.Since I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshiresharesonlyif you expect to hold them for at least five years. Those who seek short-term profits should lookelsewhere.Another warning: Berkshire shares should not be purchased with borrowed money. There have been threetimes since 1965 when our stock has fallen about 50% from its high point. Someday, something close tothis kind of drop will happen again, and no one knows when. Berkshire will almost certainly be asatisfactory holding forinvestors. But it could well be a disastrous choice for speculators employingleverage.\n\u2039I believe the chance of any event causing Berkshire to experience financial problems is essentially zero.We will always be prepared for the thousand-year flood; in fact, if it occurs we will be selling life jacketsto the unprepared. Berkshire played an important role as a \u201cfirst responder\u201d during the 2008-2009meltdown, and we have since more than doubled the strength of our balance sheet and our earningspotential. Your company is the Gibraltar of American business and will remain so.Financial staying power requires a company to maintain three strengths under allcircumstances: (1) a large and reliable stream of earnings; (2) massive liquid assets and (3) nosignificant near-term cash requirements. Ignoring that last necessity is what usually leads companies to experience unexpectedproblems: Too often, CEOs of profitable companies feel they will always be able to refund maturingobligations, however large these are. In 2008-2009, many managements learned how perilous that mindsetcan be.Here\u2019s how we willalwaysstand on the three essentials. First, our earnings stream is huge and comes froma vast array of businesses. Our shareholders now own many large companies that have durable competitiveadvantages, and we will acquire more of those in the future. Our diversification assures Berkshire\u2019scontinued profitability, even if a catastrophe causes insurance losses that far exceed any previouslyexperienced.34Next up is cash. At a healthy business, cash is sometimes thought of as something to be minimized \u2013 as anunproductive asset that acts as a drag on such markers as return on equity. Cash, though, is to a business asoxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind when it is absent.American business provided a case study of that in 2008. In September of that year, many long-prosperouscompanies suddenly wondered whether their checks would bounce in the days ahead. Overnight, theirfinancial oxygen disappeared.At Berkshire, our \u201cbreathing\u201d went uninterrupted. Indeed, in a three-week period spanning late Septemberand early October, we supplied $15.6billionof fresh money to American businesses.We could do that because we always maintain at least $20 billion \u2013 and usually far more \u2013 in cashequivalents. And by that we mean U.S. Treasury bills, not other substitutes for cash that are claimed todeliver liquidity and actually do so,exceptwhen it is truly needed. When bills come due, only cash is legaltender. Don\u2019t leave home without it.Finally \u2013 getting to our third point \u2013 we will never engage in operating or investment practices that canresult in sudden demands for large sums. That means we will not expose Berkshire to short-term debtmaturities of size nor enter into derivative contracts or other business arrangements that could require largecollateral calls.Some years ago, we became a party to certain derivative contracts that we believed were significantlymispriced and that had only minor collateral requirements. These have proved to be quite profitable.Recently, however, newly-written derivative contracts have required full collateralization. And that endedour interest in derivatives, regardless of what profit potential they might offer. We have not, for someyears, written these contracts, except for a few needed for operational purposes at our utility businesses.Moreover, we will not write insurance contracts that give policyholders the right to cash out at their option.Manylifeinsurance products contain redemption features that make them susceptible to a \u201crun\u201d in times ofextreme panic. Contracts of that sort, however, do not exist in the property-casualty world that we inhabit. Ifour premium volume should shrink, our float would decline \u2013 but only at a very slow pace.The reason for our conservatism, which may impress some people as extreme, is that it is entirelypredictable that people will occasionally panic, but not at all predictable when this will happen. Thoughpractically all days are relatively uneventful, tomorrow is alwaysuncertain. (I felt no special apprehension on December 6, 1941 or September 10, 2001.) And if you can\u2019t predict what tomorrow will bring, youmust be prepared for whatever it does.A CEO who is 64 and plans to retire at 65 may have his own special calculus in evaluating risks that haveonly a tiny chance of happening in a given year. He may, in fact, be \u201cright\u201d 99% of the time. Those odds,however, hold no appeal for us. We will never play financial Russian roulette with the funds you\u2019veentrusted to us, even if the metaphorical gun has 100 chambers and only one bullet. In our view, it ismadness to risk losing what youneedin pursuing what you simplydesire.\n\u2039Despite our conservatism, I think we will be able everyyear to build the underlying per-share earning power of Berkshire. That doesnotmean operating earnings will increase each year \u2013 far from it. The U.S.economy will ebb and flow \u2013 though mostly flow \u2013 and, when it weakens, so will our current earnings. Butwe will continue to achieve organic gains, make bolt-on acquisitions and enter new fields. I believe,therefore, that Berkshire will annually add to its underlyingearning power. In some years the gains will be substantial, and at other times they will be minor. Markets, competition,and chance will determine when opportunities come our way. Through it all, Berkshire will keep movingforward, powered by the array of solid businesses we now possess and the new companies we willpurchase. In most years, moreover, our country\u2019s economy will provide a strong tailwind for business. Weare blessed to have the United States as our home field.35\u2039The bad news is that Berkshire\u2019s long-term gains \u2013 measured by percentages, not by dollars \u2013 cannot bedramatic andwill not come closeto those achieved in the past 50 years. The numbers have become too big.I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won\u2019t begreat.Eventually \u2013 probably between ten and twenty years from now \u2013 Berkshire\u2019s earnings and capital resourceswill reach a level that will not allow management to intelligently reinvest all of the company\u2019s earnings. Atthat time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings isthrough dividends, share repurchases or both. If Berkshire shares are selling below intrinsic business value,massive repurchases will almost certainly be the best choice. You can be comfortable that your directorswill make the right decision.\n\u2039No company will be more shareholder-minded than Berkshire. For more than 30 years, we have annuallyreaffirmed our Shareholder Principles (see page 117), always leading off with: \u201cAlthough our form iscorporate, our attitude is partnership.\u201d This covenant with you is etched in stone.We have an extraordinarily knowledgeable and business-oriented board of directors ready to carry out thatpromise of partnership. None took the job for the money: In an arrangement almost non-existent elsewhere,our directors are paid only token fees. They receive their rewards instead through ownership of Berkshireshares and the satisfaction that comes from being good stewards of an important enterprise.The shares that they and their families own \u2013 which, in many cases, are worth very substantial sums \u2013 werepurchasedin the market (rather than their materializing through options or grants). In addition, unlikealmost all other sizable public companies, we carry no directors and officers liability insurance. AtBerkshire, directors walk in your shoes.To further ensure continuation of our culture, I have suggested that my son, Howard, succeed me as a non- executiveChairman. My only reason for this wish is to make change easier if the wrong CEO should everbe employed and there occurs a need for the Chairman to move forcefully. I can assure you that thisproblem has averylow probability of arising at Berkshire \u2013 likely as low as at any public company. In myservice on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I\u2019ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocreCEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)If elected, Howard will receive no pay and will spend no time at the job other than that required of alldirectors. He will simply be a safety valve to whom any director can go if he or she has concerns about theCEO and wishes to learn if other directors are expressing doubts as well. Should multiple directors beapprehensive, Howard\u2019s chairmanship will allow the matter to be promptly and properly addressed.\n\u2039Choosing the right CEO is all-important and is a subject that commands much time at Berkshire boardmeetings. Managing Berkshire is primarily a job of capital allocation, coupled with the selection andretention of outstanding managers to captain our operating subsidiaries. Obviously, the job also requires thereplacement of a subsidiary\u2019s CEO when that is called for. These duties require Berkshire\u2019s CEO to be arational, calm and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights intohuman behavior. It\u2019s important as well that he knows his limits. (As Tom Watson, Sr. of IBM said, \u201cI\u2019m nogenius, but I\u2019m smart in spots and I stay around those spots.\u201d)Character is crucial: A Berkshire CEO must be \u201call in\u201d for the company, not for himself. (I\u2019m using malepronouns to avoid awkward wording, but gender should never decide who becomes CEO.) He can\u2019t helpbut earn money far in excess of any possible need for it. But it\u2019s important that neither ego nor avaricemotivate him to reach for pay matching his most lavishly-compensated peers, even if his achievements farexceed theirs. A CEO\u2019s behavior has a huge impact on managers down the line: If it\u2019s clear to them thatshareholders\u2019 interests are paramount to him, they will, with few exceptions, also embrace that way ofthinking.36My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay,which are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency. When these corporate cancers metastasize, even thestrongest of companies can falter. The examples available to prove the point are legion, but to maintainfriendships I will exhume only cases from the distant past.In their glory days, General Motors, IBM, Sears Roebuck and U.S. Steel sat atop huge industries. Theirstrengths seemed unassailable. But the destructive behavior I deplored above eventually led each of them tofall to depths that their CEOs and directors had not long before thought impossible. Their one-timefinancial strength and their historical earning power proved no defense.Only a vigilant and determined CEO can ward off such debilitating forces as Berkshire grows ever larger.He must never forget Charlie\u2019s plea: \u201cTell me where I\u2019m going to die, so I\u2019ll never go there.\u201d If our non-economic values were to be lost, much of Berkshire\u2019s economic value would collapse as well. \u201cTone at thetop\u201d will be key to maintaining Berkshire\u2019s special culture.Fortunately, the structure our future CEOs will need to be successful is firmly in place. The extraordinarydelegation of authority now existing at Berkshire is the ideal antidote to bureaucracy. In an operating sense,Berkshire is not a giant company but rather a collection of large companies. At headquarters, we havenever had a committee nor have we ever required our subsidiaries to submit budgets (though many usethem as an important internal tool). We don\u2019t have a legal office nor departments that other companies takefor granted: human relations, public relations, investor relations, strategy, acquisitions, you name it.We do, of course, have an active audit function; no sense being a damned fool. To an unusual degree,however, we trust our managers to run their operations with a keen sense of stewardship. After all, theywere doing exactly that before we acquired their businesses. With only occasional exceptions, furthermore,our trust produces better results than would be achieved by streams of directives, endless reviews andlayers of bureaucracy. Charlie and I try to interact with our managers in a manner consistent with what wewould wish for, if the positions were reversed.\n\u2039Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshireboard has grown to know well. Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relativelyyoung, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average wellover ten years at the helm. (It\u2019s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65either (or have you noticed?).In both Berkshire\u2019s business acquisitions and large, tailored investment moves, it is important that ourcounterparties be both familiar with and feel comfortable with Berkshire\u2019s CEO. Developing confidence ofthat sort and cementing relationships takes time. The payoff, though, can be huge.Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO \u2013 a successor ready toassume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a betterjob than I am doing.\n\u2039Investments will always be of great importance to Berkshire and will be handled by several specialists.They will report to the CEO because their investment decisions, in a broad way, will need to becoordinated with Berkshire\u2019s operating and acquisition programs. Overall, though, our investmentmanagers will enjoy great autonomy. In this area, too, we are in fine shape for decades to come. ToddCombs and Ted Weschler, each of whom has spent several years on Berkshire\u2019s investment team, are first-rate in all respects and can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions.All told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie and I leave the scene. We have the rightpeople in place \u2013 the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture,furthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, bothgood and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners andoperating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kindandpermanenthome.37\u2039I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t salute another key constituency that makes Berkshire special: our shareholders.Berkshire truly has an owner base unlike that of any other giant corporation. That fact was demonstrated inspades at last year\u2019s annual meeting, where the shareholders were offered a proxy resolution:RESOLVED: Whereas the corporation has more money than it needs and since the owners unlikeWarren are not multi billionaires, the board shall consider paying a meaningful annual dividend onthe shares.The sponsoring shareholder of that resolution never showed up at the meeting, so his motion was notofficially proposed. Nevertheless, the proxy votes had been tallied, and they were enlightening.Not surprisingly, the A shares \u2013 owned by relatively few shareholders, each with a large economic interest\u2013 voted \u201cno\u201d on the dividend question by a margin of 89 to 1.The remarkable vote was that of our B shareholders. They number in the hundreds of thousands \u2013 perhapseven totaling one million \u2013 and they voted 660,759,855 \u201cno\u201d and 13,927,026 \u201cyes,\u201d a ratio of about 47 to 1.Our directors recommended a \u201cno\u201d vote but the company did not otherwise attempt to influenceshareholders. Nevertheless, 98% of the shares voting said, in effect, \u201cDon\u2019t send us a dividend but insteadreinvest all of the earnings.\u201d To have our fellow owners \u2013 large and small \u2013 be so in sync with ourmanagerial philosophy is both remarkable and rewarding.I am a lucky fellow to have you as partners.Warren E. Buffett\n38Vice Chairman\u2019s Thoughts \u2013 Past and FutureTo the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:I closely watched the 50-year history of Berkshire\u2019s uncommon success under Warren Buffett. And it now seemsappropriate that I independently supplement whatever celebratory comment comes from him. I will try to do fivethings.(1) Describe the management system and policies that caused a small and unfixably-doomed commoditytextile business to morph into the mighty Berkshire that now exists,(2) Explain how the management system and policies came into being,(3) Explain, to some extent, why Berkshire did so well,(4) Predict whether abnormally good results would continue if Buffett were soon to depart, and(5) Consider whether Berkshire\u2019s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may prove usefulelsewhere.The management system and policies of Berkshire under Buffett (herein together called \u201cthe Berkshire system\u201d)were fixed early and are described below:(1) Berkshire would be a diffuse conglomerate, averse only to activities about which it could not make usefulpredictions.(2) Its top company would do almost all business through separately incorporated subsidiaries whose CEOswould operate with very extreme autonomy.(3) There would be almost nothing at conglomerate headquarters except a tiny office suite containing aChairman, a CFO, and a few assistants who mostly helped the CFO with auditing, internal control, etc.(4) Berkshire subsidiaries would always prominently include casualty insurers. Those insurers as a groupwould be expected to produce, in due course, dependable underwriting gains while also producingsubstantial \u201cfloat\u201d (from unpaid insurance liabilities) for investment.(5) There would be no significant system-wide personnel system, stock option system, other incentive system,retirement system, or the like, because the subsidiaries would have their own systems, often different.(6) Berkshire\u2019s Chairman would reserve only a few activities for himself.(i) He would manage almost all security investments, with these normally residing in Berkshire\u2019scasualty insurers.(ii) He would choose all CEOs of important subsidiaries, and he would fix their compensation andobtain from each a private recommendation for a successor in case one was suddenly needed.(iii) He would deploy most cash not needed in subsidiaries after they had increased their competitiveadvantage, with the ideal deployment being the use of that cash to acquire new subsidiaries.(iv) He would make himself promptly available for almost any contact wanted by any subsidiary\u2019sCEO, and he would require almost no additional contact.(v) He would write a long, logical, and useful letter for inclusion in his annual report, designed as hewould wish it to be if he were only a passive shareholder, and he would be available for hours ofanswering questions at annual shareholders\u2019 meetings.(vi) He would try to be an exemplar in a culture that would work well for customers, shareholders,and other incumbents for a long time, both before and after his departure.(vii) His first priority would be reservation of much time for quiet reading and thinking, particularlythat which might advance his determined learning, no matter how old he became; and39(viii) He would also spend much time in enthusiastically admiring what others were accomplishing.(7) New subsidiaries would usually be bought with cash, not newly issued stock.(8) Berkshire would not pay dividends so long as more than one dollar of market value for shareholders wasbeing created by each dollar of retained earnings.(9) In buying a new subsidiary, Berkshire would seek to pay a fair price for a good business that the Chairmancould pretty well understand. Berkshire would also want a good CEO in place, one expected to remain for along time and to manage well without need for help from headquarters.(10) In choosing CEOs of subsidiaries, Berkshire would try to secure trustworthiness, skill, energy, and love forthe business and circumstances the CEO was in.(11) As an important matter of preferred conduct, Berkshire would almost never sell a subsidiary.(12) Berkshire would almost never transfer a subsidiary\u2019s CEO to another unrelated subsidiary.(13) Berkshire would never force the CEO of a subsidiary to retire on account of mere age.(14) Berkshire would have little debt outstanding as it tried to maintain (i) virtually perfect creditworthinessunder all conditions and (ii) easy availability of cash and credit for deployment in times presenting unusualopportunities.(15) Berkshire would always be user-friendly to a prospective seller of a large business. An offer of such abusiness would get prompt attention. No one but the Chairman and one or two others at Berkshire wouldever know about the offer if it did not lead to a transaction. And they would never tell outsiders about it.Both the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation Iknow of has half of such elements in place.How did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?Well, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire\u2019s shares and was completely trustedby all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did so, creating the Berkshiresystem.Almost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help maximize Berkshire\u2019sachievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations. Indeed, Berkshire\u2019ssubsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And some flourished while usingdifferent systems.What was Buffett aiming at as he designed the Berkshire system?Well, over the years I diagnosed several important themes:(1) He particularly wanted continuous maximization of the rationality, skills, and devotion of the mostimportant people in the system, starting with himself.(2) He wanted win/win results everywhere--in gaining loyalty by giving it, for instance.(3) He wanted decisions that maximized long-term results, seeking these from decision makers who usuallystayed long enough in place to bear the consequences of decisions.(4) He wanted to minimize the bad effects that would almost inevitably come from a large bureaucracy atheadquarters.(5) He wanted to personally contribute, like Professor Ben Graham, to the spread of wisdom attained.When Buffett developed the Berkshire system, did he foresee all the benefits that followed? No. Buffett stumbled intosome benefits through practice evolution. But, when he saw useful consequences, he strengthened their causes.40Why did Berkshire under Buffett do so well?Only four large factors occur to me:(1) The constructive peculiarities of Buffett,(2) The constructive peculiarities of the Berkshire system,(3) Good luck, and(4) The weirdly intense, contagious devotion of some shareholders and other admirers, including some in thepress.I believe all four factors were present and helpful. But the heavy freight was carried by the constructivepeculiarities, the weird devotion, and their interactions.In particular, Buffett\u2019s decision to limit his activities to a few kinds and to maximize his attention to them, and tokeep doing so for 50 years, was a lollapalooza. Buffett succeeded for the same reason Roger Federer became goodat tennis.Buffett was, in effect, using the winning method of the famous basketball coach, John Wooden, who won mostregularly after he had learned to assign virtually all playing time to his seven best players. That way, opponentsalways faced his best players, instead of his second best. And, with the extra playing time, the best players improvedmore than was normal.And Buffett much out-Woodened Wooden, because in his case the exercise of skill was concentrated in one person,not seven, and his skill improved and improved as he got older and older during 50 years, instead of deterioratinglike the skill of a basketball player does.Moreover, by concentrating so much power and authority in the often-long-serving CEOs of important subsidiaries,Buffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there. And such effects enhanced the skills of the CEOs andthe achievements of the subsidiaries.Then, as the Berkshire system bestowed much-desired autonomy on many subsidiaries and their CEOs, andBerkshire became successful and well known, these outcomes attracted both more and better subsidiaries intoBerkshire, and better CEOs as well.And the better subsidiaries and CEOs then required less attention from headquarters, creating what is often called a\u201cvirtuous circle.\u201dHow well did it work out for Berkshire to always include casualty insurers as important subsidiaries?Marvelously well. Berkshire\u2019s ambitions were unreasonably extreme and, even so, it got what it wanted.Casualty insurers often invest in common stocks with a value amounting roughly to their shareholders\u2019 equity, asdid Berkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries. And the S&P 500 Index produced about 10% per annum, pre-tax, during thelast 50 years, creating a significant tailwind.And, in the early decades of the Buffett era, common stocks within Berkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries greatlyoutperformed the index, exactly as Buffett expected. And, later, when both the large size of Berkshire\u2019sstockholdings and income tax considerations caused the index-beating part of returns to fade to insignificance(perhaps not forever), other and better advantage came. Ajit Jain created out of nothing an immense reinsurancebusiness that produced both a huge \u201cfloat\u201d and a large underwriting gain. And all of GEICO came into Berkshire,followed by a quadrupling of GEICO\u2019s market share. And the rest of Berkshire\u2019s insurance operations hugelyimproved, largely by dint of reputational advantage, underwriting discipline, finding and staying within good niches,and recruiting and holding outstanding people.41Then, later, as Berkshire\u2019s nearly unique and quite dependable corporate personality and large size became wellknown, its insurance subsidiaries got and seized many attractive opportunities, not available to others, to buyprivately issued securities. Most of these securities had fixed maturities and produced outstanding results.Berkshire\u2019s marvelous outcome in insurance was not a natural result. Ordinarily, a casualty insurance business is aproducer of mediocre results, even when very well managed. And such results are of little use. Berkshire\u2019s betteroutcome was so astoundingly large that I believe that Buffett would now fail to recreate it if he returned to a smallbase while retaining his smarts and regaining his youth.Did Berkshire suffer from being a diffuse conglomerate? No, its opportunities were usefully enlarged by a widenedarea for operation. And bad effects, common elsewhere, were prevented by Buffett\u2019s skills.Why did Berkshire prefer to buy companies with cash, instead of its own stock? Well, it was hard to get anything inexchange for Berkshire stock that was as valuable as what was given up.Why did Berkshire\u2019s acquisition of companies outside the insurance business work out so well for Berkshireshareholders when the normal result in such acquisitions is bad for shareholders of the acquirer?Well, Berkshire, by design, had methodological advantages to supplement its better opportunities. It never had theequivalent of a \u201cdepartment of acquisitions\u201d under pressure to buy. And it never relied on advice from \u201chelpers\u201dsure to be prejudiced in favor of transactions. And Buffett held self-delusion at bay as he underclaimed expertisewhile he knew better than most corporate executives what worked and what didn\u2019t in business, aided by his longexperience as a passive investor. And, finally, even when Berkshire was getting much better opportunities than mostothers, Buffett often displayed almost inhuman patience and seldom bought. For instance, during his first ten yearsin control of Berkshire, Buffett saw one business (textiles) move close to death and two new businesses come in, fora net gain of one.What were the big mistakes made by Berkshire under Buffett? Well, while mistakes of commission were common,almost all huge errors were in not making a purchase, including not purchasing Walmart stock when that was sure towork out enormously well. The errors of omission were of much importance. Berkshire\u2019s net worth would now be atleast $50 billion higher if it had seized several opportunities it was not quite smart enough to recognize as virtuallysure things.The next to last task on my list was: Predict whether abnormally good results would continue at Berkshire if Buffettwere soon to depart.The answer is yes. Berkshire has in place in its subsidiaries much business momentum grounded in much durablecompetitive advantage.Moreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in newfixed assets. And many subsidiaries are now engaged in making wise \u201cbolt-on\u201d acquisitions.Provided that most of the Berkshire system remains in place, the combined momentum and opportunity now presentis so great that Berkshire would almost surely remain a better-than-normal company for a very long time even if(1) Buffett left tomorrow, (2) his successors were persons of only moderate ability, and (3) Berkshire never againpurchased a large business.But, under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be \u201cof only moderate ability.\u201d Forinstance, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel are proven performers who would probably be under-described as \u201cworld-class.\u201d\u201cWorld-leading\u201d would be the description I would choose. In some important ways, each is a better businessexecutive than Buffett.And I believe neither Jain nor Abel would (1) leave Berkshire, no matter what someone else offered or (2) desiremuch change in the Berkshire system.42Nor do I think that desirable purchases of new businesses would end with Buffett\u2019s departure. With Berkshire nowso large and the age of activism upon us, I think some desirable acquisition opportunities will come and thatBerkshire\u2019s $60 billion in cash will constructively decrease.My final task was to consider whether Berkshire\u2019s great results over the last 50 years have implications that mayprove useful elsewhere.The answer is plainly yes. In its early Buffett years, Berkshire had a big task ahead: turning a tiny stash into a largeand useful company. And it solved that problem by avoiding bureaucracy and relying much on one thoughtful leaderfor a long, long time as he kept improving and brought in more people like himself.Compare this to a typical big-corporation system with much bureaucracy at headquarters and a long succession ofCEOs who come in at about age 59, pause little thereafter for quiet thought, and are soon forced out by a fixedretirement age.I believe that versions of the Berkshire system should be tried more often elsewhere and that the worst attributes ofbureaucracy should much more often be treated like the cancers they so much resemble. A good example ofbureaucracy fixing was created by George Marshall when he helped win World War II by getting from Congress theright to ignore seniority in choosing generals. Sincerely,Charles T.

Starting in 1979,accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, whichwas previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire\u2019s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all otherrespects, the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would havelagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed anegative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2016 was $27.5 billion, which increased the per-share book valueof both our Class A and Class B stock by 10.7%. Over the last 52 years (that is, since present management tookover), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $172,108, a rate of 19% compounded annually.*During the first half of those years, Berkshire\u2019s net worth was roughly equal to the number that reallycounts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of ourresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the taxthat would be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very largepart \u201cmarked to market.\u201dBy the early 1990s, however, our focus was changing to the outright ownership of businesses, a shiftthat materially diminished the relevance of balance sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because theaccounting rules (commonly referred to as \u201cGAAP\u201d) that apply to companies we control differ in important waysfrom those used to value marketable securities. Specifically, the accounting for businesseswe own requires that the carrying value of \u201closers\u201d be written down when their failures become apparent. \u201cWinners,\u201d conversely, areneverrevalued upwards.We\u2019ve experienced both outcomes: As is the case in marriage, business acquisitions often deliversurprisesafterthe \u201cI do\u2019s.\u201d I\u2019ve made some dumb purchases, paying far too much for the economic goodwill ofcompanies we acquired. That later led to goodwill write-offs and to consequent reductions in Berkshire\u2019s bookvalue. We\u2019ve also had some winners among the businesses we\u2019ve purchased \u2013 a few of the winners very big \u2013but have not written those up by a penny.We have no quarrel with the asymmetrical accounting that applies here. But, over time, it necessarilywidens the gap between Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value and its book value. Today, the large \u2013 and growing \u2013unrecorded gains at our winners produce an intrinsic value for Berkshire\u2019s shares that farexceeds their book value. The overage is truly huge in our property/casualty insurance business and significant also in many otheroperations.Over time, stock prices gravitate toward intrinsic value. That\u2019s what has happened at Berkshire, a factexplaining why the company\u2019s 52-year market-price gain \u2013 shown on the facing page \u2013 materially exceeds itsbook-value gain.* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500\nthof those shown for A. 3What We Hope to AccomplishCharlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire\u2019s normalized earning power per share to increase every year. Actualearnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of periodic weakness in the U.S. economy. In addition, insurance mega-catastrophes or other industry-specificevents may occasionally reduce earnings at Berkshire, even when most American businesses are doing well.It\u2019s our job, though, to over time deliver significant growth, bumpy or not. After all, as stewards of your capital, Berkshire directors have opted to retain all earnings. Indeed, in both 2015 and 2016 Berkshire rankedfirst among American businesses in the dollar volume of earnings retained, in each year reinvesting manybillions of dollars more than did the runner-up. Those reinvested dollars must earn their keep.Some years, the gains in underlying earning power we achieve will be minor; very occasionally, thecash register will ring loud. Charlie and I have no magic plan to add earnings except to dream big and to beprepared mentally and financially to act fast when opportunities present themselves. Every decade or so, darkclouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it\u2019simperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.I earlier described our gradual shift from a company obtaining most of its gains from investmentactivities to one that grows in value by owning businesses. Launching that transition, we took baby steps \u2013making small acquisitions whose impact on Berkshire\u2019s profits was dwarfed by our gains from marketablesecurities. Despite that cautious approach, I made one particularly egregious error, acquiring Dexter Shoe for$434 million in 1993. Dexter\u2019s value promptly went to zero. The story gets worse: I used stock for the purchase,giving the sellers 25,203 shares of Berkshire that at yearend 2016 were worth more than $6 billion.That wreck was followed by three key happenings \u2013 two positive, one negative \u2013 that set us firmly onour present course. At the beginning of 1996, we acquired the half of GEICO we didn\u2019t already own, a cashtransaction that changed our holding from a portfolio investment into a wholly-owned operating business.GEICO, with its almost unlimited potential, quickly became the centerpiece around which we built what I believeis now the world\u2019s premier property/casualty business.Unfortunately, I followed the GEICO purchase by foolishly using Berkshire stock \u2013 a boatloadof stock \u2013 to buy General Reinsurance in late 1998. After some early problems, General Re has become a fineinsurance operation that we prize. It was, nevertheless, a terrible mistake on my part to issue 272,200 shares ofBerkshire in buying General Re, an act that increased our outstanding shares by a whopping 21.8%. My errorcaused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that \u2013 despite the Biblicalendorsement \u2013 is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).Early in 2000, I atoned for that folly by buying 76% (since grown to 90%) of MidAmerican Energy, abrilliantly-managed utility business that has delivered us many large opportunities to make profitable andsocially-useful investments. The MidAmerican cashpurchase \u2013 I was learning \u2013 firmly launched us on our present course of (1) continuing to build our insurance operation; (2) energetically acquiring large and diversifiednon-insurance businesses and (3) largely making our deals from internally-generated cash. (Today, I would ratherprep for a colonoscopy than issue Berkshire shares.)Our portfolio of bonds and stocks, de-emphasized though it is, has continued in the post-1998 period togrow and to deliver us hefty capital gains, interest, and dividends. Those portfolio earnings have provided usmajor help in financing the purchase of businesses. Though unconventional, Berkshire\u2019s two-pronged approachto capital allocation gives us a real edge.\n4Here\u2019s our financial record since 1999, when the redirection of our business began in earnest. Duringthe 18-year period covered, Berkshire\u2019s outstanding shares grew by only 8.3%, with most of the increaseoccurring when we purchased BNSF. That, I\u2019m happy to say, was one issuance of stock that made good sense.After-Tax Earnings(in billions of dollars)Year\nOperations (1)CapitalGains (2)\nYear Operations (1)CapitalGains (2)\n1999 0.670.892008 9.64(4.65) 2000 0.942.392009 7.570.49 2001 (0.13)0.922010 11.091.87 2002 3.720.572011 10.78(0.52) 2003 5.422.732012 12.602.23 2004 5.052.262013 15.144.34 2005 5.003.532014 16.553.32 2006 9.311.712015 17.366.73 2007 9.633.582016 17.576.50(1) Including interest and dividends from investments, but excludingcapital gains or losses. (2) In very large part, this tabulation includes only realizedcapital gains or losses. Unrealized gains and losses are also included, however, when GAAP requires that treatment.Our expectation is that investment gains will continue to be substantial \u2013 though totally random as totiming \u2013 and that these will supply significant funds for business purchases. Concurrently, Berkshire\u2019s superbcorps of operating CEOs will focus on increasing earnings at the individual businesses they manage, sometimeshelping them to grow by making bolt-on acquisitions. By our avoiding the issuance of Berkshire stock, anyimprovement in earnings will translate into equivalent per-share gains.************Our efforts to materially increase the normalized earnings of Berkshire will be aided \u2013 as they have beenthroughout our managerial tenure \u2013 by America\u2019s economic dynamism. One word sums up our country\u2019sachievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago \u2013 a span of time less than triple my days onearth \u2013 Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitiousimmigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.You need not be an economist to understand how well our system has worked. Just look around you.See the 75 million owner-occupied homes, the bountiful farmland, the 260 million vehicles, the hyper-productivefactories, the great medical centers, the talent-filled universities, you name it \u2013 they all represent a net gain forAmericans from the barren lands, primitive structures and meager output of 1776. Starting from scratch, Americahas amassed wealth totaling $90 trillion.\n5It\u2019s true, of course, that American owners of homes, autos and other assets have often borrowed heavilyto finance their purchases. If an owner defaults, however, his or her asset does not disappear or lose itsusefulness. Rather, ownership customarily passes to an American lending institution that then disposes of it to anAmerican buyer. Ournation\u2019swealth remains intact. As Gertrude Stein put it, \u201cMoney is always there, but thepockets change.\u201dAbove all, it\u2019s our market system \u2013 an economic traffic cop ably directing capital, brains and labor \u2013that has created America\u2019s abundance. This system has also been the primary factor in allocating rewards.Governmental redirection, through federal, state and local taxation, has in addition determined the distribution ofa significant portion of the bounty.America has, for example, decided that those citizens in their productive years should help both the oldand the young. Such forms of aid \u2013 sometimes enshrined as \u201centitlements\u201d \u2013 are generally thought of as applyingto the aged. But don\u2019t forget that four million American babies are born each year with an entitlement to a publiceducation. That societal commitment, largely financed at the local level, costs about $150,000 per baby. Theannual cost totals more than $600 billion, which is about 3\n1\u20442% of GDP. However our wealth may be divided, the mind-boggling amounts you see around you belong almostexclusively to Americans. Foreigners, of course, own or have claims on a modest portion of our wealth. Thoseholdings, however, are of little importance to our national balance sheet: Ourcitizens own assets abroad that are roughly comparable in value.Early Americans, we should emphasize, were neither smarter nor more hard working than those peoplewho toiled century after century before them. But those venturesome pioneers crafted a system that unleashedhuman potential, and their successors built upon it.This economic creation will deliver increasing wealth to our progeny far into the future. Yes, thebuild-up of wealth will be interrupted for short periods from time to time. It will not ,however, be stopped. I\u2019ll repeat what I\u2019ve both said in the past and expect to say in future years: Babies born in America today are theluckiest crop in history.************America\u2019s economic achievements have led to staggering profits for stockholders. During the 20\nth\ncentury the Dow-Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497, a 17,320% capital gain that was materiallyboosted by steadily increasing dividends. The trend continues: By yearend 2016, the index had advanced afurther 72%, to 19,763.American business \u2013 and consequently a basket of stocks \u2013 is virtually certain to be worth far more inthe years ahead. Innovation, productivity gains, entrepreneurial spirit and an abundance of capital will see to that.Ever-present naysayers may prosper by marketing their gloomy forecasts. But heaven help them if they act on thenonsense they peddle.Many companies, of course, will fall behind, and some will fail. Winnowing of that sort is a product ofmarket dynamism. Moreover, the years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines \u2013 even panics \u2013that will affect virtually all stocks. No one can tell you when these traumas will occur \u2013 not me, not Charlie, noteconomists, not the media. Meg McConnell of the New York Fed aptly described the reality of panics: \u201cWespend a lot of time looking for systemic risk; in truth, however, it tends to find us.\u201dDuring such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friendas an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personalfear is your enemy. It will also be unwarranted. Investors who avoid high and unnecessary costs and simply sit for an extended period with acollection of large, conservatively-financed American businesses will almost certainly do well.As for Berkshire, our size precludes abrilliantresult: Prospective returns fall as assets increase. Nonetheless, Berkshire\u2019s collection of good businesses, along with the company\u2019s impregnable financial strengthand owner-oriented culture, should deliver decent results. We won\u2019t be satisfied with less. 6Share RepurchasesIn the investment world, discussions about share repurchases often become heated. But I\u2019d suggest thatparticipants in this debate take a deep breath: Assessing the desirability of repurchases isn\u2019t that complicated.From the standpoint of exiting shareholders, repurchases are always a plus. Though the day-to-day impact ofthese purchases is usually minuscule, it\u2019s always better for a seller to have an additional buyer in the market.For continuing shareholders, however, repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a pricebelow intrinsic value. When that rule is followed, the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsicvalue. Consider a simple analogy: If there are three equal partners in a business worth $3,000 and one is boughtout by the partnership for $900, each of the remaining partners realizes an immediate gain of $50. If the exitingpartner is paid $1,100, however, the continuing partners each suffer a loss of $50. The same math applies withcorporations and their shareholders. Ergo, the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing orvalue-destroying for continuing shareholders is entirely purchase-price dependent.It is puzzling, therefore, that corporate repurchase announcements almost never refer to a price abovewhich repurchases will be eschewed. That certainly wouldn\u2019t be the case if a management was buying an outsidebusiness. There, price would always factor into a buy-or-pass decision.When CEOs or boards are buying a small part of their own company, though, they all too often seemoblivious to price. Would they behave similarly if they were managing a private company with just a few ownersand were evaluating the wisdom of buying out one of them? Of course not.It is important to remember that there are two occasions in which repurchases should not take place,even if the company\u2019s shares are underpriced. One is when a business both needs all its available money toprotect or expand its own operations and is also uncomfortable adding further debt. Here, the internal need forfunds should take priority. This exception assumes, of course, that the business has a decent future awaiting itafter the needed expenditures are made.The second exception, less common, materializes when a business acquisition (or some other investmentopportunity) offers far greater value than do the undervalued shares of the potential repurchaser. Long ago,Berkshire itself often had to choose between these alternatives. At our present size, the issue is far less likely toarise.My suggestion: Before even discussing repurchases, a CEO and his or her Board should stand, joinhands and in unison declare, \u201cWhat is smart at one price is stupid at another.\u201d************To recap Berkshire\u2019s own repurchase policy: I am authorized to buy large amounts of Berkshire shares at120% or less of book value because our Board has concluded that purchases at that level clearly bring an instant andmaterial benefit to continuing shareholders. By our estimate, a 120%-of-book price is a significant discount toBerkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, a spread that is appropriate because calculations of intrinsic value can\u2019t be precise.The authorization given me does not mean that we will \u201cprop\u201d our stock\u2019s price at the 120% ratio. Ifthat level is reached, we will instead attempt to blend a desire to make meaningful purchases at a value-creatingprice with a related goal of not over-influencing the market.To date, repurchasing our shares has proved hard to do. That may well be because we have been clear indescribing our repurchase policy and thereby have signaled our view that Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value issignificantly higher than 120% of book value. If so, that\u2019s fine. Charlie and I prefer to see Berkshire shares sell ina fairly narrow range around intrinsic value, neither wishing them to sell at an unwarranted high price \u2013 it\u2019s nofun having owners who are disappointed with their purchases \u2013 nor one too low. Furthermore, our buying out\u201cpartners\u201d at a discount is not a particularly gratifying way of making money. Still, market circumstances couldcreate a situation in which repurchases would benefit both continuing and exiting shareholders. If so, we will beready to act. 7One final observation for this section: As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some peoplehave come close to calling them un-American \u2013 characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert fundsneeded for productive endeavors. That simply isn\u2019t the case: Both American corporations and private investorsare today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I\u2019m not aware of anyenticing project that in recent years has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)InsuranceLet\u2019s now look at Berkshire\u2019s various businesses, starting with our most important sector, insurance.The property/casualty (\u201cP/C\u201d) branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our growth since1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million.Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measured by net worth.One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receivepremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos,payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding largesums \u2013 money we call \u201cfloat\u201d \u2013 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float fortheir own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holdsusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does ourfloat. Andhowit has grown, as the following table shows:Year\nFloat (in millions)\n1970$ 391980 2371990 1,6322000 27,8712010 65,8322016 91,577We recently wrote a huge policy that increased float to more than $100 billion. Beyond that one-timeboost, float at GEICO and several of our specialized operations is almost certain to grow at a good clip. NationalIndemnity\u2019s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of large run-off contracts whose float is certainto drift downward.We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be verygradual \u2013 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can neverbe subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This structure is bydesign and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. It will neverbe compromised.If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registersan underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, weenjoy the use of free money \u2013 and, better yet, get paidfor holding it.Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, sovigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that theinsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earningsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\n8This outcome is made more certain by the dramatically lower interest rates that now exist throughout theworld. The investment portfolios of almost all P/C companies \u2013 though notthose of Berkshire \u2013 are heavily concentrated in bonds. As these high-yielding legacy investments mature and are replaced by bonds yielding apittance, earnings from float will steadily fall. For that reason, and others as well, it\u2019s a good bet that industryresults over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly in the case ofcompanies that specialize in reinsurance.Nevertheless, I very much like our own prospects. Berkshire\u2019s unrivaled financial strength allows us farmore flexibility in investing than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to usare always an advantage; occasionally, they offer us major opportunities. When others are constrained, ourchoices expand.Moreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at anunderwriting profit for 14 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $28 billion. Thatrecord is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of allof our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give thatmessage lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\u2019s bookvalue is calculated, thefullamount of our float is deducted as aliability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But tothink of float as a typical liability is a major mistake. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, wepay old claims and related expenses \u2013 a huge $27 billion to more than six million claimants in 2016 \u2013 and thatreduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding tofloat.If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of thisliability isdramaticallyless than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \u2013because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \u2013 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go outthe door tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \u201cgoodwill\u201d asset that we incurred in buyingour insurance companies and that is included in our book-value figure. In very large part, this goodwill representsthe price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill,however, hasnobearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolongedunderwriting losses,anygoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its originalcost.Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of ourinsurance goodwill \u2013 what we would happily pay for float of similar qualitywere we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it \u2013 to befarin excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billionwe carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000 when float was $28 billion.Yet we have subsequently increased our float by $64 billion, a gain that in no way is reflected in our book value.This unrecorded asset is one reason \u2013 a huge reason \u2013 why we believe Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic business value farexceeds its book value.************Berkshire\u2019s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers runningdisciplined operations that in most cases possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about themajor units.First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insuresrisks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed,decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposesBerkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.9Indeed, Berkshire isfarmore conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if theinsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \u2013 a loss about tripleanything it has ever experienced \u2013 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a large profit for the year. Our manystreams of non-insurance earnings would see to that. Additionally, we would remain awash in cash and be eagerto write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers andreinsurers would be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.When Ajit entered Berkshire\u2019s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day\u2019s experience in theinsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to oursmall and struggling reinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has createdtens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap mefor him,don\u2019t hesitate. Make the trade!************We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed until recently by Tad Montross. After39 years at General Re, Tad retired in 2016. Tad was a class act in every way and we owe him a ton of thanks.Kara Raiguel, who has worked with Ajit for 16 years, is now CEO of General Re.At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profitafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if theappropriate premium can\u2019t be obtained.Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\u2019t turn their back onbusiness that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \u201cThe other guy is doing it, so we mustas well,\u201d spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Tad never listened to thatnonsensical excuse for sloppy underwriting, and neither will Kara.************Finally, there is GEICO, the company that set my heart afire 66 years ago (and for which the flame stillburns). GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 55 years of service in2016.Tony became CEO of GEICO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying. There is nobetter manager than Tony, who brings his combination of brilliance, dedication andsoundness to the job. (The latter quality is essential to sustained success. As Charlie says, it\u2019s great to have a manager with a 160 IQ \u2013 unless hethinks it\u2019s 180.) Like Ajit, Tony has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire.On my initial visit to GEICO in 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the companyenjoyed over the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICO would succeed because it deservedto succeed. The company\u2019s annual sales were then $8 million; In 2016, GEICO did that much business every threehours of the year.Auto insurance is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \u2013 and only a low-costoperation can deliver those. In fact, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring withGEICO. So stop reading \u2013 right now! \u2013 and go to geico.com or call 800-847-7536.GEICO\u2019s low costs create a moat \u2013 anenduringone \u2013 that competitors are unable to cross. As a result, the company gobbles up market share year after year, ending 2016 with about 12% of industry volume. That\u2019s upfrom 2.5% in 1995, the year Berkshire acquired control of GEICO. Employment, meanwhile, grew from 8,575 to36,085.10GEICO\u2019s growth accelerated dramatically during the second half of 2016. Loss costs throughout theauto-insurance industry had been increasing at an unexpected pace and some competitors lost their enthusiasmfor taking on new customers. GEICO\u2019s reaction to the profit squeeze, however, was to accelerateits new-business efforts. We like to make hay while the sun sets, knowing that it will surely rise again. GEICO continues on a roll as I send you this letter. When insurance prices increase, people shop more.And when they shop, GEICO wins.Have you called yet? (800-847-7536 or go to geico.com)************In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a collection of smaller companies thatprimarily write commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operationthat consistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually one much superior to that reported by their competitors.Over the past 14 years, this group has earned $4.7 billion from underwriting \u2013 about 13% of its premiumvolume \u2013 while increasing its float from $943 million to $11.6 billion.Less than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBHSI\u201d), which isincluded in this grouping. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge, a move that proved to be ahome run: We expected significant losses in the early years while Peter built the personnel and infrastructureneeded for a world-wide operation. Instead, he and his crew delivered significant underwriting profits throughoutthe start-up period. BHSI\u2019s volume increased 40% in 2016, reaching $1.3 billion. It\u2019s clear to me that thecompany is destined to become one of the world\u2019s leading P/C insurers.Here\u2019s a recap ofpre-tax underwriting earnings and float by division:Underwriting Profit\nYearend Float\n(in millions) Insurance Operations\n2016 2015 2016 2015\nBH Reinsurance.................................... $ 822 $ 421 $ 45,081 $ 44,108 General Re........................................... 190 132 17,699 18,560 GEICO................................................ 462 460 17,148 15,148 Other Primary....................................... 657 824 11,649 9,906\n$2,131 $1,837 $ 91,577 $ 87,722\nBerkshire\u2019s great managers, premier financial strength and a range of business models protected by widemoats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset forBerkshire shareholders that time will only make more valuable.Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesOur BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d), our 90%-owned utility business, shareimportant characteristics that distinguish them from Berkshire\u2019s other activities. Consequently, we assign themtheir own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet andincome statement. These two very major companies accounted for 33% of Berkshire\u2019s after-tax operatingearnings last year.\n11A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets,with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is notguaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions wouldfar exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF\u2019s interestcoverage was more than 6:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes tointerest,notEBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\u2019s ability to service its debt under allcircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from thesecompanies offering an essential service for which demand is remarkably steady. The second is enjoyed by fewother utilities: an ever-widening diversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed byany single regulatory body. These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of thecompany being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lowertheir cost of debt. That economic fact benefits both us andour customers. All told, BHE and BNSF invested $8.9 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitmentto their segments of America\u2019s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promisereasonable returns \u2013 and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will foreverneed huge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capitalproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in ourself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people theyrepresent.Low prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE\u2019s average retail rate is7.1\u00a2 per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.9\u00a2. Here are the comparableindustry figures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0\u00a2, Missouri 9.5\u00a2, Illinois 9.2\u00a2, Minnesota 10.0\u00a2. The nationalaverage is 10.3\u00a2. We have promised Iowans that our base rates will not increase until 2029 at the earliest. Our rock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.At BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because ofsignificant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance the load is carried. To supply a very crude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was 3\u00a2 last year, while shipping costs for customers of theother four major U.S.-based railroads ranged from 4\u00a2 to 5\u00a2.Both BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, nostate comes close to rivaling Iowa, where last year the megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 55% ofall megawatt-hours sold to our Iowa retail customers. New wind projects that are underway will take that figureto 89% by 2020.Bargain-basement electric rates carry second-order benefits with them. Iowa has attracted large high-tech installations, both because of its low prices for electricity (which data centers use in huge quantities) andbecause most tech CEOs are enthusiastic about using renewable energy. When it comes to wind energy, Iowa isthe Saudi Arabia of America.BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freightalmost 500 miles. Those economics make railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroadsalleviate highway congestion \u2013 and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heaviertraffic \u2013 in a major way.\n12All told, BHE and BNSF own assets that are of major importance to our country as well as toshareholders of Berkshire. Here are the key financial figures for both:BNSF\nEarnings (in millions)\n2016 2015 2014\nRevenues.................................................................................. $ 19,829 $ 21,967 $ 23,239 Operating expenses.................................................................... 13,144 14,264 16,237\nOperating earnings before interest and taxes....................................6,685 7,703 7,002 Interest (net)............................................................................. 992 928 833Income taxes............................................................................. 2,124 2,527 2,300\nNet earnings.............................................................................. $ 3,569 $ 4,248 $ 3,869\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy (90% owned) Earnings (in millions)\n2016 2015 2014\nU.K. utilities............................................................................. $ 367 $ 460 $ 527Iowa utility............................................................................... 392 292 270Nevada utilities......................................................................... 559 586 549PacifiCorp (primarily Oregon and Utah).........................................1,105 1,026 1,010 Gas pipelines (Northern Natural and Kern River) ............................. 413 401 379 Canadian transmission utility....................................................... 147 170 16Renewable projects.................................................................... 157 175 194HomeServices........................................................................... 225 191 139Other (net)................................................................................ 73 49 54\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes ......................3,438 3,350 3,138 Interest.................................................................................... 465 499 427Income taxes............................................................................. 431 481 616\nNet earnings.............................................................................. $ 2,542 $ 2,370 $ 2,095\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire................................................... $2,287 $ 2,132 $ 1,882\nHomeServices may appear out of place in the above table. But it came with our purchase ofMidAmerican (now BHE) in 1999 \u2013 and we are lucky that it did.HomeServices owns 38 realty companies with more than 29,000 agents who operate in 28 states. Lastyear it purchased four realtors, including Houlihan Lawrence, the leader in New York\u2019s Westchester County (in atransaction that closed shortly after yearend).In real estate parlance, representing either a buyer or a seller is called a \u201cside,\u201d with the representation ofboth counting as two sides. Last year, ourownedrealtors participated in 244,000 sides, totaling $86 billion in volume.HomeServices alsofranchisesmany operations throughout the country that use our name. We like bothaspects of the real estate business and expect to acquire many realtors and franchisees during the next decade.\n13Manufacturing, Service and Retailing OperationsOur manufacturing, service and retailing operations sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes.Let\u2019s look, though, at a summary balance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group.Balance Sheet 12/31/16 (in millions)\nAssets Liabilities and Equity\nCash and equivalents........................... $8,073 Notes payable................................ $2,054 Accounts and notes receivable..............11,183 Other current liabilities....................12,464\nInventory..........................................15,727 Total current liabilities.....................14,518 Other current assets.............................1,039\nTotal current assets.............................36,022Deferred taxes................................12,044 Goodwill and other intangibles..............71,473 Term debt and other liabilities...........10,943 Fixed assets.......................................18,915 Non-controlling interests.................. 579 Other assets.......................................3,183 Berkshire equity.............................91,509\n$129,593 $129,593\nEarnings Statement (in millions)\n2016 2015 2014\nRevenues................................................................ $120,059 $107,825 $97,689 Operating expenses...................................................111,383 100,607 90,788 Interest expense........................................................ 214 103 109\nPre-tax earnings....................................................... 8,462 7,115 6,792 Income taxes and non-controlling interests....................2,831 2,432 2,324\nNet earnings............................................................ $ 5,631 $ 4,683 $ 4,468\nIncluded in this financial summary are 44 businesses that report directly to headquarters. But some ofthese companies, in turn, have many individual operations under their umbrella. For example, Marmon has 175separate business units, serving widely disparate markets, and Berkshire Hathaway Automotive owns 83dealerships, operating in nine states.This collection of businesses is truly a motley crew. Some operations, measured by earnings onunleveraged nettangibleassets, enjoy terrific returns that, in a couple of instances, exceed 100%. Most are solidbusinesses generating good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.\n14A few, however \u2013 these are serious blunders I made in my job of capital allocation \u2013 produce very poorreturns. In most cases, I was wrong when I originally sized up the economic characteristics of these companies orthe industries in which they operate, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. In a couple ofinstances, I stumbled in assessing either the fidelity or ability of incumbent managers or ones I later put in place.I will commit more errors; you can count on that. Fortunately, Charlie \u2013 never bashful \u2013 is around to say \u201cno\u201d tomy worst ideas.Viewed as a single entity, the companies in the manufacturing, service and retailing group are anexcellent business. They employed an average of $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2016 and, despite theirholding large quantities of excess cash and carrying very little debt, earned 24% after-tax on that capital.Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price.We have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in thelarge figure we show on our balance sheet for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting adecent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector. Absent a recession, earnings from the group willlikely grow in 2017, in part because Duracell and Precision Castparts (both bought in 2016) will for the first timecontribute a full year\u2019s earnings to this group. Additionally, Duracell incurred significant transitional costs in2016 that will not recur.We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, theircompetitors \u2013 both current and potential \u2013 read this report. In a few of our businesses, we might be disadvantagedif outsiders knew our numbers. Therefore, in certain of our operations that are not of a size material to anevaluation of Berkshire, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail aboutmany of our operations on pages 90 - 94. Be aware, though, that it\u2019s the growth of the Berkshire forest thatcounts. It would be foolish to focus over-intently on any single tree.************For several years I have told you that the income and expense data shown in this section does notconform to GAAP. I have explained that this divergence occurs primarily because of GAAP-ordered rulesregarding purchase-accounting adjustments that require the full amortization of certain intangibles over periodsaveraging about 19 years. In our opinion, most of those amortization \u201cexpenses\u201d are not truly an economic cost.Our goal in diverging from GAAP in this section is to present the figures to you in a manner reflecting the way inwhich Charlie and I view and analyze them.On page 54 we itemize $15.4 billion of intangibles that are yet to be amortized by annual charges toearnings. (More intangibles to be amortized will be created as we make new acquisitions.) On that page, we showthat the 2016 amortization charge to GAAP earnings was $1.5 billion, up $384 million from 2015. My judgmentis that about 20% of the 2016 charge is a \u201creal\u201d cost.Eventually amortization charges fully write off the related asset. When that happens \u2013 most often at the15-year mark \u2013 the GAAP earnings we report will increase without any true improvement in the underlyingeconomics of Berkshire\u2019s business. (My gift to my successor.)Now that I\u2019ve described a GAAP expense that I believe to be overstated, let me move on to a lesspleasant distortion produced by accounting rules. The subject this time is GAAP-prescribed depreciation charges,which are necessarily based on historical cost. Yet in certain cases, those charges materially understatetrue economic costs. Countless words were written about this phenomenon in the 1970s and early 1980s, wheninflation was rampant. As inflation subsided \u2013 thanks to heroic actions by Paul Volcker \u2013 the inadequacy ofdepreciation charges became less of an issue. But the problem still prevails, big time, in the railroad industry, where current costs for many depreciable items far outstrip historical costs. The inevitable result is that reportedearnings throughout the railroad industry are considerably higher than true economic earnings.\n15At BNSF, to get down to particulars, our GAAP depreciation charge last year was $2.1 billion. But werewe to spend that sum and no more annually, our railroad would soon deteriorate and become less competitive.The reality is that \u2013simply to hold our own\u2013 we need to spend far more than the cost we show for depreciation.Moreover, a wide disparity will prevail for decades.All that said, Charlie and I love our railroad, which was one of our better purchases.************Too many managements \u2013 and the number seems to grow every year \u2013 are looking for any means toreport,and indeed feature, \u201cadjusted earnings\u201d that are higher than their company\u2019s GAAP earnings. There aremany ways for practitioners to perform this legerdemain. Two of their favorites are the omission of\u201crestructuring costs\u201d and \u201cstock-based compensation\u201d as expenses.Charlie and Iwantmanagements,in their commentary, to describe unusual items \u2013 good or bad \u2013 that affect the GAAP numbers. After all, the reason we look at these numbers of the past is to make estimates of thefuture. But a management that regularly attempts to wave away very real costs by highlighting \u201cadjustedper-share earnings\u201d makes us nervous. That\u2019s because bad behavior is contagious: CEOs who overtly look forways to report high numbers tend to foster a culture in which subordinates strive to be \u201chelpful\u201d as well. Goalslike that can lead, for example, to insurers underestimating their loss reserves, a practice that has destroyed manyindustry participants.Charlie and I cringe when we hear analysts talk admiringly about managements who always \u201cmake thenumbers.\u201d In truth, business is too unpredictable for the numbers always to be met. Inevitably, surprises occur.When they do, a CEO whose focus is centered on Wall Street will be tempted to make upthe numbers. Let\u2019s get back to the two favorites of \u201cdon\u2019t-count-this\u201d managers, starting with \u201crestructuring.\u201dBerkshire, I would say, has been restructuring from the first day we took over in 1965. Owning only a northerntextile business then gave us no other choice. And today a fair amount of restructuring occurs every year atBerkshire. That\u2019s because there are always things that need to change in our hundreds of businesses. Last year, asI mentioned earlier, we spent significant sums getting Duracell in shape for the decades ahead.We have never, however, singled out restructuring charges and told you to ignore them in estimating ournormal earning power. If there were to be some truly major expenses in a single year, I would, of course, mentionit in my commentary. Indeed, when there is a total rebasing of a business, such as occurred when Kraft and Heinzmerged, it is imperative that for several years the huge one-time costs of rationalizing the combined operations beexplained clearly to owners. That\u2019s precisely what the CEO of Kraft Heinz has done, in a manner approved bythe company\u2019s directors (who include me). But, to tell owners year after year, \u201cDon\u2019t count this,\u201d whenmanagement is simply making business adjustments that are necessary, is misleading. And too many analysts andjournalists fall for this baloney.To say \u201cstock-based compensation\u201d is not an expense is even more cavalier. CEOs who go down thatroad are, in effect, saying to shareholders, \u201cIf you pay me a bundle in options or restricted stock, don\u2019t worryabout its effect on earnings. I\u2019ll \u2018adjust\u2019 it away.\u201dTo explore this maneuver further, join me for a moment in a visit to a make-believe accountinglaboratory whose sole mission is to juice Berkshire\u2019s reportedearnings. Imaginative technicians await us, eager to show their stuff.\n16Listen carefully while I tell these enablers that stock-based compensation usually comprises at least 20%of total compensation for the top three or four executives at most large companies. Pay attention, too, as I explainthat Berkshire has several hundred such executives at its subsidiaries and pays them similar amounts, but usesonly cash to do so. I further confess that, lacking imagination, I have counted allof these payments to Berkshire\u2019s executives as an expense.My accounting minions suppress a giggle and immediately point out that 20% of what is paid theseBerkshire managers is tantamount to \u201ccash paid in lieu of stock-based compensation\u201d and is therefore not a\u201ctrue\u201d expense. So \u2013 presto! \u2013 Berkshire, too, can have \u201cadjusted\u201d earnings.Back to reality: If CEOs want to leave out stock-based compensation in reporting earnings, they shouldbe required to affirmto their ownersone of two propositions: why items of value used to pay employees are not acost or why a payroll cost should be excluded when calculating earnings.During the accounting nonsense that flourished during the 1960s, the story was told of a CEO who, ashis company revved up to go public, asked prospective auditors, \u201cWhat is two plus two?\u201d The answer that wonthe assignment, of course, was, \u201cWhat number do you have in mind?\u201dFinance and Financial ProductsOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), andMarmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). Each is the leader inits field.We also include Clayton Homes in this section. This company receives most of its revenue from the saleof manufactured homes, but derives the bulk of its earningsfrom its large mortgage portfolio. Last year, Clayton became America\u2019s largest home builder, delivering 42,075 units that accounted for 5% of all new Americanhomes. (In fairness, other large builders do far more dollarvolume than Clayton because they sell site-built homes that command much higher prices.)In 2015, Clayton branched out, purchasing its first site-builder. Two similar acquisitions followed in2016, and more will come. Site-built houses are expected to amount to 3% or so of Clayton\u2019s unit sales in 2017and will likely deliver about 14% of its dollar volume.Even so, Clayton\u2019s focus will always be manufactured homes, which account for about 70% of newAmerican homes costing less than $150,000. Clayton manufactures close to one-half of the total. That is a far cryfrom Clayton\u2019s position in 2003 when Berkshire purchased the company. It then ranked third in the industry inunits sold and employed 6,731 people. Now, when its new acquisitions are included, the employee count is14,677. And that number will increase in the future.Clayton\u2019s earnings in recent years have materially benefited from extraordinarily low interest rates. Thecompany\u2019s mortgage loans to home-buyers are at fixed-rates and for long terms (averaging 25 years atinception). But Clayton\u2019s own borrowings are short-term credits that re-price frequently. When rates plunge,Clayton\u2019s earnings from its portfolio greatly increase. We normally would shun that kind of lend-long, borrow-short approach, which can cause major problems for financial institutions. As a whole, however, Berkshire isalways asset-sensitive, meaning that higher short-term rates will benefit our consolidatedearnings, even as they hurt at Clayton.\n17Last year Clayton had to foreclose on 8,304 manufactured-housing mortgages, about 2.5% of its totalportfolio. Customer demographics help explain that percentage. Clayton\u2019s customers are usually lower-incomefamilies with mediocre credit scores; many are supported by jobs that will be at risk in any recession; many,similarly, have financial profiles that will be damaged by divorce or death to an extent that would not be typicalfor a high-income family. Those risks that our customers face are partly mitigated because almost all have astrong desire to own a home and because they enjoy reasonable monthly payments that average only $587,includingthe cost of insurance and property taxes.Clayton also has long had programs that help borrowers through difficulties. The two most popular areloan extensions and payment forgiveness. Last year about 11,000 borrowers received extensions, and 3,800 had$3.4 million of scheduled payments permanently canceled by Clayton. The company does not earn interest orfees when these loss-mitigation moves are made. Our experience is that 93% of borrowers helped through theseprograms in the last two years now remain in their homes. Since we lose significant sums onforeclosures \u2013 losses last year totaled $150 million \u2013 our assistance programs end up helping Clayton as well asits borrowers.Clayton and Berkshire have been a wonderful partnership. Kevin Clayton came to us with a best-in-classmanagement group and culture. Berkshire, in turn, provided unmatched staying power when the manufactured-home industry fell apart during the Great Recession. (As other lenders to the industry vanished, Clayton suppliedcredit not only to its own dealers but also to dealers who sold the products of its competitors.) At Berkshire, wenever count on synergies when we acquire companies. Truly important ones, however, surfaced after ourpurchase of Clayton.Marmon\u2019s railcar business experienced a major slowdown in demand last year, which will causeearnings to decline in 2017. Fleet utilization was 91% in December, down from 97% a year earlier, with the dropparticularly severe at the large fleet we purchased from General Electric in 2015. Marmon\u2019s crane and containerrentals have weakened as well.Big swings in railcar demand have occurred in the past and they will continue. Nevertheless, we verymuch like this business and expect decent returns on equity capital over the years. Tank cars are Marmon\u2019sspecialty. People often associate tank cars with the transportation of crude oil; in fact, they are essential to a greatvariety of shippers.Over time, we expect to expand our railcar operation. Meanwhile, Marmon is making a number ofbolt-on acquisitions whose results are included in the Manufacturing, Service and Retailing section.Here\u2019s thepre-tax earnings recap for our finance-related companies: 2016\n2015 2014\n(in millions) Berkadia (our 50% share)............................................ $ 91 $ 74 $ 122Clayton.................................................................... 744 706 558CORT...................................................................... 60 55 49Marmon \u2013 Containers and Cranes................................. 126 192 238Marmon \u2013 Railcars..................................................... 654 546 442XTRA..................................................................... 179 172 147Net financial income*................................................. 276 341 283\n$ 2,130 $ 2,086 $ 1,839\n* Excludes capital gains or losses18InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.

Each, independently, manages more than $10 billion; I usually learn about decisions they have made by looking at monthly trade sheets. Included in the $21 billion that the twomanage is about $7.6 billion of pension trust assets of certain Berkshire subsidiaries. As noted, pensioninvestments are not included in the preceding tabulation of Berkshire holdings.************Excluded from the table \u2013but important\u2013 is our ownership of $5 billion of preferred stock issued by Bank of America. This stock, which pays us $300 million per year, also carries with it a valuable warrantallowing Berkshire to purchase 700 million common shares of Bank of America for $5 billion at any time beforeSeptember 2, 2021. At yearend, that privilege would have delivered us a profit of $10.5 billion. If it wishes,Berkshire can use its preferred shares to satisfy the $5 billion cost of exercising the warrant.\n19If the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock \u2013 now 30 cents annually \u2013 should rise above44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common. If thecommon dividend remains below 44 cents, it is highly probable that we will exercise the warrant immediatelybefore it expires.Many of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quiteaggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most casesbeen underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.) When a company grows andoutstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.************It\u2019s important for you to understand that 95% of the $86 billion of \u201ccash and equivalents\u201d (which in mymind includes U.S. Treasury Bills) shown on our balance sheet are held by entities in the United States and,consequently, is not subject to any repatriation tax. Moreover, repatriation of the remaining funds would triggeronly minor taxes because much of that money has been earned in countries that themselves impose meaningfulcorporate taxes. Those payments become an offset to U.S. tax when money is brought home.These explanations are important because many cash-rich American companies hold a large portion oftheir funds in jurisdictions imposing very low taxes. Such companies hope \u2013 and may well be proved right \u2013 thatthe tax levied for bringing these funds to America will soon be materially reduced. In the meantime, thesecompanies are limited as to how they can use that cash. In other words, off-shore cash is simply not worth asmuch as cash held at home.Berkshire has a partial offset to the favorable geographical location of its cash, which is that much of itis held in our insurance subsidiaries. Though we have many alternatives for investing this cash, we do not havethe unlimited choices that we would enjoy if the cash were held by the parent company, Berkshire. We dohave an ability annually to distribute large amounts of cash from our insurers to the parent \u2013 though here, too, there arelimits. Overall, cash held at our insurers is a very valuable asset, but one slightly less valuable to us than is cashheld at the parent level.************Sometimes the comments of shareholders or media imply that we will own certain stocks \u201cforever.\u201d It istrue that we own some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as the eye can see (and we\u2019re talking20/20 vision). But we have made nocommitmentthat Berkshire will holdanyof its marketable securities forever. Confusion about this point may have resulted from a too-casual reading of Economic Principle 11 onpages 110 - 111, which has been included in our annual reports since 1983. That principle covers controlled businesses, not marketable securities. This year I\u2019ve added a final sentence to #11 to ensure that our ownersunderstand that we regard any marketable security as available for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems.************Before we leave this investment section, a few educational words about dividends and taxes: Berkshire,like most corporations, nets considerablymorefrom a dollar of dividends than it reaps from a dollar of capitalgains. That will probably surprise those of our shareholders who are accustomed to thinking of capital gains asthe route to tax-favored returns.But here\u2019s thecorporatemath. Every $1 of capital gains that a corporation realizes carries with it35 cents of federal income tax (and often state income tax as well). The tax on dividends received from domestic corporations, however, is consistently lower, though rates vary depending on the status of the recipient.\n20For a non-insurance company \u2013 which describes Berkshire Hathaway, the parent \u2013 the federal tax rate iseffectively 10\n1\u20442cents per $1 of dividends received. Furthermore, a non-insurance company that owns more than20% of an investee owes taxes of only 7 cents per $1 of dividends. That rate applies, for example, to thesubstantial dividends we receive from our 27% ownership of Kraft Heinz, all of it held by the parent company.(The rationale for the low corporate taxes on dividends is that the dividend-paying investee has already paid itsown corporate tax on the earnings being distributed.)Berkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries pay a tax rate on dividends that is somewhat higher than that applyingto non-insurance companies, though the rate is still well below the 35% hitting capital gains. Property/casualtycompanies owe about 14% in taxes on most dividends they receive. Their tax rate falls, though, to about 11% ifthey own more than 20% of a U.S.-based investee.And that\u2019s our tax lesson for today.\u201cThe Bet\u201d (or how your money finds its way to Wall Street)In this section, you will encounter, early on, the story of an investment bet I made nine years ago and,next, some strong opinions I have about investing. As a starter, though, I want to briefly describe Long Bets, aunique establishment that played a role in the bet.Long Bets was seeded by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and operates as a non-profit organization thatadministers just what you\u2019d guess: long-term bets. To participate, \u201cproposers\u201d post a proposition at Longbets.orgthat will be proved right or wrong at a distant date. They then wait for a contrary-minded party to take the otherside of the bet. When a \u201cdoubter\u201d steps forward, each side names a charity that will be the beneficiary if its sidewins; parks its wager with Long Bets; and posts a short essay defending its position on the Long Bets website.When the bet is concluded, Long Bets pays off the winning charity.Here are examples of what you will find on Long Bets\u2019 very interesting site:In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that \u201cBy 2029 no computer \u2013 or \u2018machine intelligence\u2019 \u2013 willhave passed the Turing Test,\u201d which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being.Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don\u2019t know who willwin this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie.That same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengersby 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburnEric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. Hepromptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I\u2019ll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment,should we lose.)Now, to my bet and its history. In Berkshire\u2019s 2005 annual report, I argued that active investmentmanagement by professionals \u2013 in aggregate \u2013 would over a period of years underperform the returns achieved byrank amateurs who simply sat still. I explained that the massive fees levied by a variety of \u201chelpers\u201d would leavetheir clients \u2013again in aggregate\u2013 worse off than if the amateurs simply invested in an unmanaged low-cost indexfund. (See pages 114 - 115 for a reprint of the argument as I originally stated it in the 2005 report.)\n21Subsequently, I publicly offered to wager $500,000 that no investment pro could select a set of at leastfive hedge funds \u2013 wildly-popular and high-fee investing vehicles \u2013 that would over an extended period matchthe performance of an unmanaged S&P-500 index fund charging only token fees. I suggested a ten-year bet andnamed a low-cost Vanguard S&P fund as my contender. I then sat back and waited expectantly for a parade offund managers \u2013 who could include their own fund as one of the five \u2013 to come forth and defend theiroccupation. After all, these managers urgedothersto bet billions on their abilities. Why should they fear putting a little of their own money on the line?What followed was the sound of silence. Though there are thousands of professional investment managerswho have amassed staggering fortunes by touting their stock-selecting prowess, only one man \u2013 Ted Seides \u2013stepped up to my challenge. Ted was a co-manager of Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, an asset manager that had raised moneyfrom limited partners to form a fund-of-funds \u2013 in other words, a fund that invests in multiple hedge funds.I hadn\u2019t known Ted before our wager, but I like him and admire his willingness to put his money wherehis mouth was. He has been both straight-forward with me and meticulous in supplying all the data that both heand I have needed to monitor the bet.For Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners\u2019 side of our ten-year bet, Ted picked five funds-of-funds whose results were to beaveraged and compared against my Vanguard S&P index fund. The five he selected had invested their money inmore than 100 hedge funds, which meant that the overall performance of the funds-of-funds would not bedistorted by the good or poor results of a single manager.Each fund-of-funds, of course, operated with a layer of fees that sat above the fees charged by the hedgefunds in which it had invested. In this doubling-up arrangement, the larger fees were levied by the underlyinghedge funds; each of the fund-of-funds imposed an additional fee for its presumed skills in selecting hedge-fundmanagers.Here are the results for the first nine years of the bet \u2013 figures leaving no doubt that Girls Inc. of Omaha,the charitable beneficiary I designated to get any bet winnings I earned, will be the organization eagerly openingthe mail next January.Year\nFund ofFunds A Fund ofFunds B Fund ofFunds C Fund ofFunds D Fund ofFunds E S&PIndex Fund\n2008 -16.5% -22.3% -21.3% -29.3% -30.1% -37.0%2009 11.3% 14.5% 21.4% 16.5% 16.8% 26.6%2010 5.9% 6.8% 13.3% 4.9% 11.9% 15.1%2011 -6.3% -1.3% 5.9% -6.3% -2.8% 2.1%2012 3.4% 9.6% 5.7% 6.2% 9.1% 16.0%2013 10.5% 15.2% 8.8% 14.2% 14.4% 32.3%2014 4.7% 4.0% 18.9% 0.7% -2.1% 13.6%2015 1.6% 2.5% 5.4% 1.4% -5.0% 1.4%2016 -2.9% 1.7% -1.4% 2.5% 4.4% 11.9%Gain toDate 8.7% 28.3% 62.8% 2.9% 7.5% 85.4%Footnote: Under my agreement with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, the names of these funds-of-funds have neverbeen publicly disclosed. I, however, see their annual audits.The compounded annual increase to date for the index fund is 7.1%, which is a return that could easilyprove typical for the stock market over time. That\u2019s an important fact: A particularly weak nine years for themarket over the lifetime of this bet would have probably helped the relative performance of the hedge funds,because many hold large \u201cshort\u201d positions. Conversely, nine years of exceptionally high returns from stockswould have provided a tailwind for index funds.Instead we operated in what I would call a \u201cneutral\u201d environment. In it, the five funds-of-fundsdelivered, through 2016, an average of only 2.2%, compounded annually. That means $1 million invested inthose funds would have gained $220,000. The index fund would meanwhile have gained $854,000. 22Bear in mind that every one of the 100-plus managers of the underlying hedge funds had a hugefinancial incentive to do his or her best. Moreover, the five funds-of-funds managers that Ted selected weresimilarly incentivized to select the best hedge-fund managers possible because the five were entitled toperformance fees based on the results of the underlying funds.I\u2019m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. Butthe results for their investors were dismal \u2013reallydismal. And, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the funds and funds-of-funds involved \u2013 fees that were totally unwarranted by performance \u2013 were such that theirmanagers were showered with compensation over the nine years that have passed. As Gordon Gekko might haveput it: \u201cFees never sleep.\u201dThe underlying hedge-fund managers in our bet received payments from their limited partners thatlikely averaged a bit under the prevailing hedge-fund standard of \u201c2 and 20,\u201d meaning a 2% annual fixed fee,payable even when losses are huge, and 20% of profits with no clawback (if good years were followed by badones). Under this lopsided arrangement, a hedge fund operator\u2019s ability to simply pile up assets undermanagement has made many of these managers extraordinarily rich, even as their investments have performedpoorly.Still, we\u2019re not through with fees. Remember, there were the fund-of-funds managers to be fed as well.These managers received an additional fixed amount that was usually set at 1% of assets. Then, despite theterrible overall record of the five funds-of-funds, some experienced a few good years and collected\u201cperformance\u201d fees. Consequently, I estimate that over the nine-year period roughly 60% \u2013 gulp! \u2013 of allgains achieved by the five funds-of-funds were diverted to the two levels of managers. That was their misbegottenreward for accomplishing something far short of what their many hundreds of limited partners could haveeffortlessly \u2013 and with virtuallynocost \u2013 achieved on their own.In my opinion, the disappointing results for hedge-fund investors that this bet exposed are almost certainto recur in the future. I laid out my reasons for that belief in a statement that was posted on the Long Bets websitewhen the bet commenced (and that is still posted there). Here is what I asserted:Over a ten-year period commencing on January 1, 2008, and ending on December 31, 2017,the S&P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds, when performance ismeasured on a basis net of fees, costs and expenses.A lot of very smart people set out to do better than average in securities markets. Call themactive investors.Their opposites, passive investors, will by definition do about average. In aggregate theirpositions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore, the balance ofthe universe\u2014the active investors\u2014must do about average as well. However, theseinvestors will incur far greater costs. So, on balance, their aggregate results after these costswill be worse than those of the passive investors.Costs skyrocket when large annual fees, large performance fees, and active trading costs areall added to the active investor\u2019s equation. Funds of hedge funds accentuate this costproblem because their fees are superimposed on the large fees charged by the hedge fundsin which the funds of funds are invested.A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent theirefforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose oninvestors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fundthan with a group of funds of funds.\n23So that was my argument \u2013 and now let me put it into a simple equation. If Group A (active investors)and Group B (do-nothing investors) comprise the total investing universe, and B is destined to achieve averageresults before costs, so, too, must A. Whichever group has the lower costs will win. (The academic in me requiresme to mention that there is a very minor point \u2013 not worth detailing \u2013 that slightlymodifies this formulation.) And if Group A has exorbitant costs, its shortfall will be substantial.There are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to out-perform the S&P over longstretches. In my lifetime, though, I\u2019ve identified \u2013 early on\u2013 only ten or so professionals that I expected would accomplish this feat.There are no doubt many hundreds of people \u2013 perhaps thousands \u2013 whom I have never met and whoseabilities would equal those of the people I\u2019ve identified. The job, after all, is not impossible. The problem simplyis that the great majority of managers who attempt to over-perform will fail. The probability is also very high thatthe person soliciting your funds will not be the exception who does well. Bill Ruane \u2013 a truly wonderful humanbeing and a man whom I identified 60 years ago as almost certain to deliver superior investment returns over thelong haul \u2013 said it well: \u201cIn investment management, the progression is from the innovators to the imitators to theswarming incompetents.\u201dFurther complicating the search for the rare high-fee manager who is worth his or her pay is the fact thatsome investment professionals, just as some amateurs, will be lucky over short periods. If 1,000 managers makea market prediction at the beginning of a year, it\u2019s very likely that the calls of at least one will be correct for nineconsecutive years. Of course, 1,000 monkeys would be just as likely to produce a seemingly all-wise prophet.But therewouldremain a difference: The lucky monkey would not find people standing in line to invest withhim.Finally, there are three connected realities that cause investing success to breed failure. First, a goodrecord quickly attracts a torrent of money. Second, huge sums invariably act as an anchor on investmentperformance: What is easy with millions, struggles with billions (sob!). Third, most managers will neverthelessseek new money because of theirpersonalequation \u2013 namely, the more funds they have under management, themore their fees.These three points are hardly new ground for me: In January 1966, when I was managing $44 million,I wrote my limited partners: \u201cI feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to helpthem. This might not be true for my own personal results, but it is likely to be true for your results. Therefore, . . .I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL. I have notified Susie that if we have any more children, it is up toher to find some other partnership for them.\u201dThe bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it willusually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stickwith low-cost index funds.************If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds.In his crusade, he amassed only a tiny percentage of the wealth that has typically flowed to managers who havepromised their investors large rewards while delivering them nothing \u2013 or, as in our bet, lessthan nothing \u2013 of added value.In his early years, Jack was frequently mocked by the investment-management industry. Today,however, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on theirsavings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.************Over the years, I\u2019ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I\u2019velearned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 indexfund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion. 24I believe, however, thatnoneof the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followedthat same advice when I\u2019ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts anddepart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out anotherbreed of hyper-helper called a consultant.That professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients,year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Largefees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. Thatadvice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment \u201cstyles\u201d or currenteconomic trends make the shift appropriate.The wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling,entertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy themsomething superior compared to what the masses receive.In many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason,the financial \u201celites\u201d \u2013 wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like \u2013 have great troublemeekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a fewthousand dollars. This reluctance of the rich normally prevails even though the product at issue is \u2013on anexpectancy basis \u2013 clearly the best choice. My calculation, admittedly very rough, is that the search by the elitefor superior investment advice has caused it, in aggregate, to waste more than $100 billion over the past decade.Figure it out: Even a 1% fee on a few trillion dollars adds up. Of course, not every investor who put money inhedge funds ten years ago lagged S&P returns. But I believe my calculation of the aggregate shortfall isconservative.Much of the financial damage befell pension funds for public employees. Many of these funds arewoefully underfunded, in part because they have suffered a double whammy: poor investment performanceaccompanied by huge fees. The resulting shortfalls in their assets will for decades have to be made up by localtaxpayers.Human behavior won\u2019t change. Wealthy individuals, pension funds, endowments and the like willcontinue to feel they deserve something \u201cextra\u201d in investment advice. Those advisors who cleverly play to thisexpectation will get very rich. This year the magic potion may be hedge funds, next year something else. Thelikely result from this parade of promises is predicted in an adage: \u201cWhen a person with money meets a personwith experience, the one with experience ends up with the money and the one with money leaves withexperience.\u201dLong ago, a brother-in-law of mine, Homer Rogers, was a commission agent working in the Omahastockyards. I asked him how he induced a farmer or rancher to hire him to handle the sale of their hogs or cattleto the buyers from the big four packers (Swift, Cudahy, Wilson and Armour). After all, hogs were hogs and thebuyers were experts who knew to the penny how much any animal was worth. How then, I asked Homer, couldany sales agent get a better result than any other?Homer gave me a pitying look and said: \u201cWarren, it\u2019s not how you sell \u2018em, it\u2019s how you tell \u2018em.\u201dWhat worked in the stockyards continues to work in Wall Street.************And, finally, let me offer an olive branch to Wall Streeters, many of them good friends of mine.Berkshireloves to pay fees \u2013 even outrageous fees \u2013 to investment bankers who bring us acquisitions. Moreover,we have paid substantial sums for over-performance to our two in-house investment managers \u2013 and we hope tomake even larger payments to them in the future.To get biblical (Ephesians 3:18), I know the height and the depth and the length and the breadth of theenergy flowing from that simple four-letter word \u2013 fees \u2013 when it is spoken to Wall Street. And when that energydelivers value to Berkshire, I will cheerfully write a big check.25The Annual MeetingLast year we partnered with Yahoo to air the first-ever webcast of our annual meeting. Thanks to AndySerwer and his Yahoo crew, the production was a success in all respects, registering 1.1 million unique visits inreal-time viewing and 11.5 million more in replays (many of those, to be sure, called up by viewers interested inonly certain segments of the webcast).Berkshire\u2019s thank-you mail for initiating the webcast included many notes from three constituencies: theelderly who find travel difficult; the thrifty who find it expensive to travel to Omaha; and those who cannotattend a Saturday meeting for religious reasons.The webcast cut attendance at last year\u2019s meeting to about 37,000 people (we can\u2019t get a precise count),which was down about 10%. Nevertheless, both Berkshire\u2019s subsidiaries and Omaha hotels and restaurantsracked up huge sales. Nebraska Furniture Mart\u2019s sales broke their 2015 record volume by 3%, with the Omahastore recording one-week volume of $45.5 million.Our Berkshire exhibitors at CenturyLink were open from noon until 5 p.m. on Friday and drew a crowdof 12,000 bargain-hunting shareholders. We will repeat those Friday shopping hours this year on May 5\nth. Bring money.The annual meeting falls on May 6\nthand will again be webcast by Yahoo, whose web address is https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream. The webcast will go live at 9 a.m. Central Daylight Time. Yahoo willinterview directors, managers, stockholders and celebrities before the meeting and during the lunch break. Boththose interviews and meeting will be translated simultaneously into Mandarin.For those attending the meeting in person, the doors at the CenturyLink will open at 7:00 a.m. onSaturday to facilitate shopping prior to our shareholder movie, which begins at 8:30. The question-and-answerperiod will start at 9:30 and run until 3:30, with a one-hour lunch break at noon. Finally, at 3:45 we will begin theformal shareholder meeting. It will run an hour or so. That is somewhat longer than usual because three proxyitems are to be presented by their proponents, who will be given a reasonable amount of time to state their case.On Saturday morning, we will have our sixth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our targetwill again be the porch of a Clayton Home, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was ateenager \u2013 in my one brief flirtation with honest labor \u2013 I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I\u2019m prettygood at this game. Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, andyou must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed). The competition will begin about 7:45, and I\u2019ll take onten or so competitors selected a few minutes earlier by my assistant, Deb Bosanek.Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in whichproducts from dozens of our subsidiaries will be for sale. Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who will becaptaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that salutes all of our companies.Your children (and you!) will be enchanted with it.Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at themeeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our fourth annual \u201cBerkshire 5K,\u201d an 8 a.m. racestarting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor\u2019s Guide that will be sentto you with your meeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many ofBerkshire\u2019s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; the fudge and peanutbrittle we eat throughout the Saturday meeting takes its toll.) Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help usset another record.\n26A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company\u2019s top counselors fromaround the country. At last year\u2019s meeting, we set a record for policy sales, up 21% from 2015. I predict we willbe up again this year.So stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point:The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bringthe details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend thesavings on other Berkshire products.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. This Omaha-based retailer will carry about 35 books and DVDs, amongthem a couple of new titles. The best book I read last year was Shoe Dog, by Nike\u2019s Phil Knight. Phil is a very wise, intelligent and competitive fellow who is also a gifted storyteller. The Bookworm will have piles of Shoe Dogas well as several investment classics by Jack Bogle.The Bookworm will once again offer our history of the highlights (and lowlights) of Berkshire\u2019s first 50years. Non-attendees of the meeting can find the book on eBay. Just type in: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Celebrating 50 years of a Profitable Partnership (2\nndEdition).An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Keep in mind that airlines havesometimes jacked up prices for the Berkshire weekend \u2013 though I must admit I have developed some tolerance,bordering on enthusiasm, for that practice now that Berkshire has made large investments in America\u2019s fourmajor carriers. Nevertheless, if you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1/2hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72\nndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having \u201cBerkshire Weekend\u201d discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you mustmake your purchases between Tuesday, May 2\nndand Monday, May 8thinclusive, and must also present your meeting credential. The period\u2019s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigiousmanufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholderweekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During \u201cBerkshire Weekend,\u201d NFMwill be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is hosting a picnic to which you are all invited.This year we have good news for shareholders in the Kansas City and Dallas metro markets who can\u2019tattend the meeting or perhaps prefer the webcast. From May 2\nndthrough May 8th, shareholders who present meeting credentials or other evidence of their Berkshire ownership (such as brokerage statements) to their localNFM store will receive the same discounts enjoyed by those visiting the Omaha store.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail receptionfrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 5\nth. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 7th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. Remember, the more you buy, the more you save(or so my daughter tells me when we visit the store).\n27We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, May 1\nstthrough Saturday, May 13th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statementshowing you own our stock.On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician and motivationalspeaker from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and SharonOsberg, two of the world\u2019s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Ifthey suggest wagering on the game, change the subject. I will join them at some point and hope Ajit, Charlie andBill Gates will do so also.My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. Imet Ariel when she was nine, and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Ariel represented theUnited States in the 2012 Olympics. Now, she\u2019s a senior at Princeton (after interning last summer at JPMorganChase). If you don\u2019t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates didpretty well playing Ariel last year, so he may be ready to again challenge her. (My advice: Bet on Ariel.)Gorat\u2019s will be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 7\nth, serving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat\u2019s, call 402-551-3733 on April 3\nrd(but not before). Show you are a sophisticated diner by ordering the T-bone with hash browns.We will have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and theire-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed atloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, ofthe New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the mostinteresting and important to shareholders. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of beingselected if you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include nomore than two questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would likeyour name mentioned if your question is asked.)An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year theinsurance specialist will be Jay Gelb of Barclays. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations willcome from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Since what wewill be conducting is ashareholders\u2019meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions thatadd to our owners\u2019 understanding and knowledge of their investment.Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will betough, for sure, and that\u2019s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren\u2019t allowed; we want to give as manyquestioners as possible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire thanwhen you came and for you to have a good time while in Omaha.All told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist andfor 18 from the audience. The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that willtake place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arenaand main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.\n28While I\u2019m on the subject of our owners\u2019 gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and Ibelieve all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, ifpossible, should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That\u2019s why wetry to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on aSaturday (a day that also eases traffic and parking problems).We do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors oranalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than theshareholder of limited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings. As I run the companyday-to-day \u2013 and as I write this letter \u2013 that is the shareholder whose image is in my mind.************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are trulyAll-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe themindset of our managers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-ownedcompanies. Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business \u201chome runs\u201d meansas much to them as their paycheck.Equally important, however, are the men and women who work with me at our corporate office. Thisteam efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,450-page Federalincome tax return, oversees the filing of 3,580 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and mediainquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country\u2019s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\u2019sactivities, fact-checks this letter \u2013 and the list goes on and on.They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealtwith the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me.They also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and Frenchfries (smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. In addition, they cheerfully pitch in to help Carrie Sova \u2013our talented ringmaster at the annual meeting \u2013 deliver an interesting and entertaining weekend for ourshareholders. They are proud to work for Berkshire, and I am proud of them.I\u2019m a lucky guy, very fortunate in being surrounded by this excellent staff, a team of highly-talentedoperating managers and a boardroom of very wise and experienced directors. Come to Omaha \u2013 the cradle ofcapitalism \u2013 on May 6\nthand meet the Berkshire Bunch. All of us look forward to seeing you.February 25, 2017 Warren E.

Starting in 1979, accountingrules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previouslythe requirement. In this table, Berkshire\u2019s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the result s are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-taxwhereas the Berkshire numbers areafter-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in yearswhen that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years,the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire\u2019s gain in net worth during 2017 was $65.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value ofboth our Class A and Class B stock by 23%. Over the last 53 years (that is, since present management took over), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $211,750, a rate of 19.1% compounded annually.*The format of that opening paragraph has been standard for 30 years. But 2017 was far from standard: Alarge portion of our gain didnotcome from anything we accomplished at Berkshire.The $65 billion gain is nonetheless real \u2013 rest assured of that. But only $36 billion came from Berkshire\u2019soperations. The remaining $29 billion was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the U.S. Tax Code.(Details of Berkshire\u2019s tax-related gain appear on page K-32 and pages K-89 \u2013 K-90.)After stating those fiscal facts, I would prefer to turn immediately to discussing Berkshire\u2019s operations. But,in still another interruption, I must first tell you about a new accounting rule \u2013 a generally accepted accountingprinciple (GAAP) \u2013 that infuturequarterly and annual reports will severely distort Berkshire\u2019s net income figures andvery often mislead commentators and investors.The new rule says that the net change inunrealizedinvestment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be included in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capriciousswings in our GAAP bottom-line. Berkshire owns $170 billion of marketable stocks (not including our shares of KraftHeinz), and the value of these holdings can easily swing by $10 billion or more within a quarterly reporting period.Including gyrations of that magnitude in reported net income will swamp the truly important numbers that describe ouroperating performance. For analytical purposes, Berkshire\u2019s \u201cbottom-line\u201d will be useless.The new rule compounds the communication problems we have long had in dealing with the realizedgains (or losses) that accounting rules compel us to include in our net income. In past quarterly and annual press releases,we have regularly warned you not to pay attention to these realized gains, because they \u2013 just like our unrealized gains\u2013 fluctuate randomly.That\u2019s largely because we sell securities when that seems the intelligent thing to do, not because we are tryingto influence earnings in any way. As a result, we sometimes have reported substantial realized gains for a period whenour portfolio, overall, performed poorly (or the converse).*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\u2019s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500\nthof those shown for the A shares.\n3With the new rule about unrealized gains exacerbating the distortion caused by the existing rules applying torealized gains, we will take pains every quarter to explain the adjustments you need in order to make sense of ournumbers. But televised commentary on earnings releases is often instantaneous with their receipt, and newspaperheadlines almost always focus on the year-over-year change in GAAP net income. Consequently, media reportssometimes highlight figures that unnecessarily frighten or encourage many readers or viewers.We will attempt to alleviate this problem by continuing our practice of publishing financial reports late onFriday, well after the markets close, or early on Saturday morning. That will allow you maximum time for analysisand give investment professionals the opportunity to deliver informed commentary before markets open on Monday.Nevertheless, I expect considerable confusion among shareholders for whom accounting is a foreign language.At Berkshire what counts most are increases in our normalized per-share earning power. That metric is whatCharlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I focus on \u2013 and we hope that you do, too. Our scorecard for 2017 follows.AcquisitionsThere are four building blocks that add value to Berkshire: (1) sizable stand-alone acquisitions; (2) bolt-onacquisitions that fit with businesses we already own; (3) internal sales growth and margin improvement at our manyand varied businesses; and (4) investment earnings from our huge portfolio of stocks and bonds. In this section, wewill review 2017 acquisition activity.In our search for new stand-alone businesses, the key qualities we seek are durable competitive strengths;able and high-grade management; good returns on the net tangible assets required to operate the business;opportunities for internal growth at attractive returns; and, finally, a sensible purchase price. That last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but farfrom spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimisticpurchasers.Why the purchasing frenzy? In part, it\u2019s because the CEO job self-selects for \u201ccan-do\u201d types. If Wall Streetanalysts or board members urge that brand of CEO to consider possible acquisitions, it\u2019s a bit like telling your ripeningteenager to be sure to have a normal sex life.Once a CEO hungers for a deal, he or she will never lack for forecasts that justify the purchase. Subordinateswill be cheering, envisioning enlarged domains and the compensation levels that typically increase with corporatesize. Investment bankers, smelling huge fees, will be applauding as well. (Don\u2019t ask the barber whether you need ahaircut.) If the historical performance of the target falls short of validating its acquisition, large \u201csynergies\u201d will beforecast. Spreadsheets never disappoint.The ample availability of extraordinarily cheap debt in 2017 further fueled purchase activity. After all, evena high-priced deal will usually boost per-share earnings if it is debt-financed. At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluateacquisitions on an all-equity basis, knowing that our taste for overall debt is very low and that to assign a large portionof our debt to any individual business would generally be fallacious (leaving aside certain exceptions, such as debtdedicated to Clayton\u2019s lending portfolio or to the fixed-asset commitments at our regulated utilities). We also neverfactor in, nor do we often find, synergies.Our aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of usbelieve it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don\u2019t need. We held this view 50 yearsago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also holdit today after a million or so \u201cpartners\u201d have joined us at Berkshire.\n4Despite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will haveopportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less theprudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own. ************We were able to make one sensible stand-alone purchase last year, a 38.6% partnership interest in Pilot FlyingJ (\u201cPFJ\u201d). With about $20 billion in annual volume, the company is far and away the nation\u2019s leading travel-centeroperator.PFJ has been run from the get-go by the remarkable Haslam family. \u201cBig Jim\u201d Haslam began with a dreamand a gas station 60 years ago. Now his son, Jimmy, manages 27,000 associates at about 750 locations throughoutNorth America. Berkshire has a contractual agreement to increase its partnership interest in PFJ to 80% in 2023;Haslam family members will then own the remaining 20%. Berkshire is delighted to be their partner.When driving on the Interstate, drop in. PFJ sells gasoline as well as diesel fuel, and the food is good. If it\u2019sbeen a long day, remember, too, that our properties have 5,200 showers. ************Let\u2019s move now to bolt-on acquisitions. Some of these were small transactions that I will not detail. Here isan account, however, of a few larger purchases whose closings stretched between late 2016 and early 2018.\n\u0160 Clayton Homes acquired two builders of conventional homes during 2017, a move that more than doubledour presence in a field we entered only three years ago. With these additions \u2013 Oakwood Homes in Colorado andHarris Doyle in Birmingham \u2013 I expect our 2018 site built volume will exceed $1 billion.Clayton\u2019s emphasis, nonetheless, remains manufactured homes, both their construction and their financing.In 2017 Clayton sold 19,168 units through its own retail operation and wholesaled another 26,706 units to independentretailers. All told, Clayton accounted for 49% of the manufactured-home market last year. That industry-leading share\u2013 about three times what our nearest competitor did \u2013 is a far cry from the 13% Clayton achieved in 2003, the year itjoined Berkshire.Both Clayton Homes and PFJ are based in Knoxville, where the Clayton and Haslam families have long beenfriends. Kevin Clayton\u2019s comments to the Haslams about the advantages of a Berkshire affiliation, and his admiringcomments about the Haslam family to me, helped cement the PFJ deal.\n\u0160 Near the end of 2016, Shaw Industries, our floor coverings business, acquired U.S. Floors (\u201cUSF\u201d), a rapidlygrowing distributor of luxury vinyl tile. USF\u2019s managers, Piet Dossche and Philippe Erramuzpe, came out of the gatefast, delivering a 40% increase in sales in 2017, during which their operation was integrated with Shaw\u2019s. It\u2019s clearthat we acquired both great human assetsandbusiness assets in making the USF purchase.Vance Bell, Shaw\u2019s CEO, originated, negotiated and completed this acquisition, which increased Shaw\u2019ssales to $5.7 billion in 2017 and its employment to 22,000. With the purchase of USF, Shaw has substantiallystrengthened its position as an important and durable source of earnings for Berkshire.\n\u0160 I have told you several times about HomeServices, our growing real estate brokerage operation. Berkshirebacked into this business in 2000 when we acquired a majority interest in MidAmerican Energy (now named BerkshireHathaway Energy). MidAmerican\u2019s activities were then largely in the electric utility field, and I originally paid littleattention to HomeServices.\n5But, year-by-year, the company added brokers and, by the end of 2016, HomeServices was the second-largestbrokerage operation in the country \u2013 still ranking, though, far behind the leader, Realogy. In 2017, however,HomeServices\u2019 growth exploded. We acquired the industry\u2019s third-largest operator, Long and Foster; number 12,Houlihan Lawrence; and Gloria Nilson.With those purchases we added 12,300 agents, raising our total to 40,950. HomeServices is now close toleading the country in home sales, having participated (including our three acquisitions pro-forma) in $127 billion of\u201csides\u201d during 2017. To explain that term, there are two \u201csides\u201d to every transaction; if we represent both buyer andseller, the dollar value of the transaction is counted twice.Despite its recent acquisitions, HomeServices is on track to do only about 3% of the country\u2019s home-brokerage business in 2018. That leaves 97% to go. Given sensible prices, we will keep adding brokers in this mostfundamental of businesses.\n\u0160 Finally, Precision Castparts, a company built through acquisitions, bought Wilhelm Schulz GmbH, aGerman maker of corrosion resistant fittings, piping systems and components. Please allow me to skip a furtherexplanation. I don\u2019t understand manufacturing operations as well as I do the activities of real estate brokers, homebuilders or truck stops.Fortunately, I don\u2019t need in this instance to bring knowledge to the table: Mark Donegan, CEO of Precision,is an extraordinary manufacturing executive, and any business in his domain is slated to do well. Betting on peoplecan sometimes be more certain than betting on physical assets.Let\u2019s now move on to operations, beginning with property-casualty (\u201cp/c\u201d) insurance, a business I do understand and the engine that for 51 years has powered Berkshire\u2019s growth.InsuranceBefore I discuss our 2017 insurance results, let me remind you of how and why we entered the field. Webegan by purchasing National Indemnity and a smaller sister company for $8.6 million in early 1967. With ourpurchase we received $6.7 million of tangible net worth that, by the nature of the insurance business, we were able todeploy in marketable securities. It was easy to rearrange the portfolio into securities we would otherwise have owned atBerkshire itself. In effect, we were \u201ctrading dollars\u201d for the net worth portion of the cost.The $1.9 million premium over net worth that Berkshire paid brought us an insurance business that usuallydelivered an underwriting profit. Even more important, the insurance operation carried with it $19.4 million of \u201cfloat\u201d\u2013 money that belonged to others but was held by our two insurers.Ever since, float has been of great importance to Berkshire. When we invest these funds, all dividends,interest and gains from their deployment belong to Berkshire. (If we experience investment losses, those, of course,are on our tab as well.)Float materializes at p/c insurers in several ways: (1) Premiums are generally paid to the company upfrontwhereas losses occur over the life of the policy, usually a six-month or one-year period; (2) Though some losses, suchas car repairs, are quickly paid, others \u2013 such as the harm caused by exposure to asbestos \u2013 may take many years tosurface and even longer to evaluate and settle; (3) Loss payments are sometimes spread over decades in cases, say, ofa person employed by one of our workers\u2019 compensation policyholders being permanently injured and thereafterrequiring expensive lifetime care.\n6Float generally grows as premium volume increases. Additionally, certain p/c insurers specialize in lines ofbusiness such as medical malpractice or product liability \u2013 business labeled \u201clong-tail\u201d in industry jargon \u2013 thatgenerate far more float than, say, auto collision and homeowner policies, which require insurers to almost immediatelymake payments to claimants for needed repairs.Berkshire has been a leader in long-tail business for many years. In particular, we have specialized in jumboreinsurancepolicies that leave us assuming long-tail losses already incurred by other p/c insurers. As a result of ouremphasizing that sort of business, Berkshire\u2019s growth in float has been extraordinary. We are now the country\u2019s secondlargest p/c company measured by premium volume and its leader, by far, in float.Here\u2019s the record: (in $ millions) Year\nPremium Volume Float\n1970 $ 39 $ 391980 185 2371990 582 1,6322000 19,343 27,8712010 30,749 65,8322017 60,597 114,500Our 2017 volume was boosted by a huge deal in which we reinsured up to $20 billion of long-tail losses thatAIG had incurred. Our premium for this policy was $10.2 billion, a world\u2019s record and one we won\u2019t come close torepeating. Premium volume will therefore fall somewhat in 2018.Float will probably increase slowly for at least a few years. When we eventually experience a decline, it willbe modest \u2013 at most 3% or so in any single year. Unlike bank deposits or life insurance policies containing surrenderoptions, p/c float can\u2019t be withdrawn. This means that p/c companies can\u2019t experience massive \u201cruns\u201d in times ofwidespread financial stress, a characteristic of prime importance to Berkshire that we factor into our investmentdecisions.Charlie and Ineverwill operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers \u2013 or eventhat of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own. During the 2008-2009 crisis, we liked havingTreasury Bills \u2013loadsof Treasury Bills \u2013 that protected us from having to rely on funding sources such as bank linesor commercial paper. We have intentionally constructed Berkshire in a manner that will allow it to comfortablywithstand economic discontinuities, including such extremes as extended market closures. ************The downside of float is that it comes with risk, sometimes oceans of risk. What looks predictable in insurancecan be anything but. Take the famous Lloyds insurance market, which produced decent results for three centuries. Inthe 1980\u2019s, though, huge latent problems from a few long-tail lines of insurance surfaced at Lloyds and, for a time,threatened to destroy its storied operation. (It has, I should add, fully recovered.)Berkshire\u2019s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that haslong prioritized those qualities. That disciplined behavior has produced underwriting profits in most years, and in suchinstances, our cost of float was less than zero. In effect, we got paidthen for holding the huge sums tallied in the earlier table.I have warned you, however, that we have been fortunate in recent years and that the catastrophe-light periodthe industry was experiencing was not a new norm. Last September drove home that point, as three significanthurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n7My guess at this time is that the insured losses arising from the hurricanes are $100 billion or so. That figure,however, could befaroff the mark. The pattern with most mega-catastrophes has been that initial loss estimates ranlow. As well-known analyst V.J. Dowling has pointed out, the loss reserves of an insurer are similar to a self-gradedexam. Ignorance, wishful thinking or, occasionally, downright fraud can deliver inaccurate figures about an insurer\u2019sfinancial condition for a very long time.We currently estimate Berkshire\u2019s losses from the three hurricanes to be $3 billion (or about $2 billion aftertax). If both that estimate and my industry estimate of $100 billion are close to accurate, our share of the industry losswas about 3%. I believe that percentage is also what we may reasonably expect to be our share of losses in futureAmerican mega-cats.It\u2019s worth noting that the $2 billion net cost from the three hurricanes reduced Berkshire\u2019s GAAP net worthby less than 1%. Elsewhere in the reinsurance industry there were many companies that suffered losses in net worthranging from 7% to more than 15%. The damage to them could have been farworse: Had Hurricane Irma followed a path through Florida only a bit to the east, insured losses might well have been an additional $100 billion.We believe that the annual probability of a U.S. mega-catastrophe causing $400 billion or more of insuredlosses is about 2%. No one, of course, knows the correct probability. We do know, however, that the risk increasesover time because of growth in both the number and value of structures located in catastrophe-vulnerable areas.No company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion mega-cat. Our shareof such a loss might be $12 billion or so, an amount far below the annual earnings we expect from our non-insuranceactivities. Concurrently, much \u2013 indeed, perhaps most \u2013 of the p/c world would be out of business. Our unparalleledfinancial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire \u2013 and onlyBerkshire \u2013 when they, themselves, need to purchase huge reinsurance coverages for large payments they may have to make in the far future.Prior to 2017, Berkshire had recorded 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits, which totaled $28.3billion pre-tax. I have regularly told you that I expect Berkshire to attain an underwriting profit in a majority of years,but also to experience losses from time to time. My warning became fact in 2017, as we lost $3.2 billion pre-tax fromunderwriting.A large amount of additional information about our various insurance operations is included in the 10-K atthe back of this report. The only point I will add here is that you have some extraordinary managers working for youat our various p/c operations. This is a business in which there are no trade secrets, patents, or locational advantages.What counts are brains and capital. The managers of our various insurance companies supply the brains and Berkshireprovides the capital. ************For many years, this letter has described the activities of Berkshire\u2019s many other businesses. That discussionhas become both repetitious and partially duplicative of information regularly included in the 10-K that follows theletter. Consequently, this year I will give you a simple summary of our dozens of non-insurance businesses. Additionaldetails can be found on pages K-5 \u2013 K-22 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-50.Viewed as a group \u2013and excluding investment income\u2013 our operations other than insurance delivered pre- tax income of $20 billion in 2017, an increase of $950 million over 2016. About 44% of the 2017 profit came from twosubsidiaries. BNSF, our railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (of which we own 90.2%). You can read moreabout these businesses on pages K-5 \u2013 K-10 and pages K-40 \u2013 K-44.Proceeding down Berkshire\u2019s long list of subsidiaries, our next five non-insurance businesses, as ranked byearnings (but presented here alphabetically) Clayton Homes, International Metalworking Companies, Lubrizol,Marmon and Precision Castparts had aggregate pre-tax income in 2017 of $5.5 billion, little changed from the $5.4billion these companies earned in 2016.The next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.1billion last year, up from $1.7 billion in 2016.8The remaining businesses that Berkshire owns \u2013 and there are many \u2013 recorded little change in pre-taxincome, which was $3.7 billion in 2017 versus $3.5 billion in 2016.Depreciation charges for all of these non-insurance operations totaled $7.6 billion; capital expenditures were$11.5 billion. Berkshire is always looking for ways to expand its businesses and regularly incurs capital expendituresthat far exceed its depreciation charge. Almost 90% of our investments are made in the United States. America\u2019seconomic soil remains fertile.Amortization charges were an additional $1.3 billion. I believe that in large part this item is not a trueeconomic cost. Partially offsetting this good news is the fact that BNSF (like all other railroads) records depreciationcharges that fall well short of the sums regularly needed to keep the railroad in first-class shape.Berkshire\u2019s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, wewill need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so. At yearend Berkshire held$116.0 billion in cash and U.S. Treasury Bills (whose average maturity was 88 days), up from $86.4 billion at yearend2016. This extraordinary liquidity earns only a pittance and is far beyond the level Charlie and I wish Berkshire tohave. Our smiles will broaden when we have redeployed Berkshire\u2019s excess funds into more productive assets.InvestmentsBelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We excludeour Kraft Heinz holding \u2013 325,442,152 shares \u2013 because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the \u201cequity\u201d method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries its Kraft Heinz holding ata GAAP figure of $17.6 billion. The shares had a yearend market value of $25.3 billion, and a cost basis of $9.8 billion. 12/31/17\nShares* CompanyPercentage ofCompanyOwned\nCost** Market\n(in millions) 151,610,700 American Express Company..................17.6 $ 1,287 $ 15,056 166,713,209 Apple Inc.................................. 3 . 3 20,961 28,213 700,000,000 Bank of America Corporation................. 6 . 85,007 20,664 53,307,534 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ...... 5 . 32,230 2,871 225,000,000 BYD Company Ltd.......................... 8 . 2 2 3 2 1,961 6,789,054 Charter Communications, Inc.................. 2 . 81,210 2,281 400,000,000 The Coca-Cola Company..................... 9 . 4 1,299 18,352 53,110,395 Delta Airlines Inc........................... 7 . 4 2,219 2,974 44,527,147 General Motors Company.................... 3 . 2 1,343 1,825 11,390,582 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc................ 3 . 0 6 5 4 2,902 24,669,778 Moody\u2019s Corporation........................12.9 248 3,642 74,587,892 Phillips 66.................................14.9 5,841 7,545 47,659,456 Southwest Airlines Co........................ 8 . 1 1,997 3,119 103,855,045 U.S. Bancorp.............................. 6 . 3 3,343 5,565 482,544,468 Wells Fargo & Company..................... 9 . 9 11,837 29,276 Others.................................... 14,968 24,294\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market......... $74,676 $ 170,540\n* Excludes shares held by pension funds of Berkshire subsidiaries.** This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP \u201ccost\u201d differs in a few cases because ofwrite-downs that have been required under GAAP rules.9Some of the stocks in the table are the responsibility of either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who work withme in managing Berkshire\u2019s investments. Each, independently of me, manages more than $12 billion; I usually learn about decisions they have made by looking at monthly portfolio summaries. Included in the $25 billion that the twomanage is more than $8 billion of pension trust assets of certain Berkshire subsidiaries. As noted, pension investmentsare not included in the preceding tabulation of Berkshire holdings. ************Charlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker symbols to be bought or sold based on their \u201cchart\u201d patterns, the \u201ctarget\u201d prices of analysts or the opinions of mediapundits. Instead, we simply believe that if the businesses of the investees are successful (as we believe most will be)our investments will be successful as well. Sometimes the payoffs to us will be modest; occasionally the cash registerwill ring loudly. And sometimes I will make expensive mistakes. Overall \u2013 and over time \u2013 we should get decentresults. In America, equity investors have the wind at their back.From our stock portfolio \u2013 call our holdings \u201cminority interests\u201d in a diversified group of publicly-ownedbusinesses \u2013 Berkshire received $3.7 billion of dividends in 2017. That\u2019s the number included in our GAAP figures,as well as in the \u201coperating earnings\u201d we reference in our quarterly and annual reports.That dividend figure, however,farunderstates the \u201ctrue\u201d earnings emanating from our stock holdings. Fordecades, we have stated in Principle 6 of our \u201cOwner-Related Business Principles\u201d (page 19) that we expectundistributedearnings of our investees to deliver us at least equivalent earnings by way of subsequent capital gains.Our recognition of capital gains (and losses) will be lumpy, particularly as we conform with the new GAAPrule requiring us to constantly recordunrealizedgains or losses in our earnings. I feel confident, however, that the earnings retained by our investees will over time, and with our investees viewed as a group, translate intocommensurate capital gains for Berkshire.The connection of value-building to retained earnings that I\u2019ve just described will be impossible to detect inthe short term. Stocks surge and swoon, seemingly untethered to any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value.Over time, however, Ben Graham\u2019s oft-quoted maxim proves true: \u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine;in the long run, however, it becomes a weighing machine.\u201d ************Berkshire, itself, provides some vivid examples of how price randomness in the short term can obscure long-term growth in value. For the last 53 years, the company has built value by reinvesting its earnings and lettingcompound interest work its magic. Year by year, we have moved forward. Yet Berkshire shares have suffered fourtruly major dips. Here are the gory details:\nPeriod High Low Percentage Decrease March 1973-January 1975 93 38 (59.1%)10/2/87-10/27/87 4,250 2,675 (37.1%)6/19/98-3/10/2000 80,900 41,300 (48.9%)9/19/08-3/5/09 147,000 72,400 (50.7%)This table offers the strongest argument I can muster against ever using borrowed money to own stocks.There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small and yourpositions aren\u2019t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlinesand breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions.\n10In the next 53 years our shares (and others) will experience declines resembling those in the table. No one can tell you when these will happen. The light can at any timego from green to red without pausing at yellow. When major declines occur, however, they offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicappedby debt. That\u2019s the time to heed these lines from Kipling\u2019s If:\u201cIf you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .If you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . .If you can think \u2013 and not make thoughts your aim . . .If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you...Yours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it.\u201d\u201cThe Bet\u201d is Over and Has Delivered an Unforeseen Investment LessonLast year, at the 90% mark, I gave you a detailed report on a ten-year bet I had made on December 19, 2007.(The full discussion from last year\u2019s annual report is reprinted on pages 24 \u2013 26.) Now I have the final tally \u2013 and, inseveral respects, it\u2019s an eye-opener.I made the bet for two reasons: (1) to leverage my outlay of $318,250 into a disproportionately larger sumthat \u2013 if things turned out as I expected \u2013 would be distributed in early 2018 to Girls Inc. of Omaha; and (2) topublicize my conviction that my pick \u2013 a virtually cost-free investment in an unmanaged S&P 500 index fund \u2013 would,over time, deliver better results than those achieved by most investment professionals, however well-regarded andincentivized those \u201chelpers\u201d may be.Addressing this question is of enormous importance. American investors pay staggering sums annually toadvisors, often incurring several layers of consequential costs. In the aggregate, do these investors get their money\u2019sworth? Indeed, again in the aggregate, do investors get anythingfor their outlays? Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, my counterparty to the bet, picked five \u201cfunds-of-funds\u201d that it expected to overperformthe S&P 500. That wasnota small sample. Those five funds-of-funds in turn owned interests in more than 200 hedgefunds.Essentially, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment expertswho, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund. Thisassemblage was an elite crew, loaded with brains, adrenaline and confidence.The managers of the five funds-of-funds possessed a further advantage: They could \u2013 and did \u2013 rearrangetheir portfolios of hedge funds during the ten years, investing with new \u201cstars\u201d while exiting their positions in hedgefunds whose managers had lost their touch.Every actor on Prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s side was highly incentivized: Both the fund-of-funds managers and the hedge-fundmanagers they selected significantly shared in gains, even those achieved simply because the market generally movesupwards. (In100%of the 43 ten-year periods since we took control of Berkshire, years with gains by the S&P 500exceeded loss years.)Those performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if thefundslostmoney for their investors during the decade, their managers could grow very rich. That would occur becausefixedfees averaging a staggering 2\n1\u20442% of assets or so were paidevery yearby the fund-of-funds\u2019 investors, with part of these fees going to the managers at the five funds-of-funds and the balance going to the 200-plus managers of theunderlying hedge funds.\n11Here\u2019s the final scorecard for the bet:Year\nFund-of-Funds A Fund-of-Funds B Fund-of-Funds C Fund-of-Funds D Fund-of-Funds E S&PIndex Fund\n2008 -16.5% -22.3% -21.3% -29.3% -30.1% -37.0%2009 11.3% 14.5% 21.4% 16.5% 16.8% 26.6%2010 5.9% 6.8% 13.3% 4.9% 11.9% 15.1%2011 -6.3% -1.3% 5.9% -6.3% -2.8% 2.1%2012 3.4% 9.6% 5.7% 6.2% 9.1% 16.0%2013 10.5% 15.2% 8.8% 14.2% 14.4% 32.3%2014 4.7% 4.0% 18.9% 0.7% -2.1% 13.6%2015 1.6% 2.5% 5.4% 1.4% -5.0% 1.4%2016 -3.2% 1.9% -1.7% 2.5% 4.4% 11.9%2017 12.2% 10.6% 15.6% N/A 18.0% 21.8%Final Gain 21.7% 42.3% 87.7% 2.8% 27.0% 125.8%AverageAnnual Gain 2.0% 3.6% 6.5% 0.3% 2.4% 8.5%Footnote: Under my agreement with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, the names of these funds-of-funds have never been publiclydisclosed. I, however, have received their annual audits from Prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The 2016 figures for funds A, Band C were revised slightly from those originally reported last year. Fund D was liquidated in 2017; itsaverage annual gain is calculated for the nine years of its operation.The five funds-of-funds got off to a fast start, each beating the index fund in 2008. Then the roof fell in. Inevery oneof the nine years that followed, the funds-of-funds as a whole trailed the index fund.Let me emphasize that there was nothing aberrational about stock-market behavior over the ten-year stretch.If a poll of investment \u201cexperts\u201d had been asked late in 2007 for a forecast of long-term common-stock returns, theirguesses would have likely averaged close to the 8.5% actually delivered by the S&P 500. Making money in thatenvironment should have been easy. Indeed, Wall Street \u201chelpers\u201d earned staggering sums. While this groupprospered, however, many of their investors experienced a lost decade.Performance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter.************The bet illuminated another important investment lesson: Though markets are generally rational, theyoccasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does notrequire great intelligence, a degree in economics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta. What investors then need instead is anability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals. A willingness to lookunimaginative for a sustained period \u2013 or even to look foolish \u2013 is also essential.Originally, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I each funded our portion of the ultimate $1 million prize by purchasing $500,000face amount of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds (sometimes called \u201cstrips\u201d). These bonds cost each of us $318,250 \u2013a bit less than 64\u00a2 on the dollar \u2013 with the $500,000 payable in ten years.As the name implies, the bonds we acquired paid no interest, but (because of the discount at which they werepurchased) delivered a 4.56% annual return if held to maturity. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I originally intended to do no more thantally the annual returns and distribute $1 million to the winning charity when the bonds matured late in 2017.\n12After our purchase, however, some very strange things took place in the bond market. By November 2012,our bonds \u2013 now with about five years to go before they matured \u2013 were selling for 95.7%of their face value. Atthat price, their annual yield to maturity was less than 1%. Or, to be precise, .88%. Given that pathetic return, our bonds had become a dumb \u2013 a reallydumb \u2013 investment compared to American equities. Over time, the S&P 500 \u2013 which mirrors a huge cross-section of American business, appropriatelyweighted by market value \u2013 has earnedfarmore than 10% annually on shareholders\u2019 equity (net worth).In November 2012, as we were considering all this, the cashreturn from dividends on the S&P 500 was 2\n1\u20442% annually, about triple the yield on our U.S. Treasury bond. These dividend payments were almost certain to grow.Beyond that, huge sums were being retained by the companies comprising the 500. These businesses would use theirretained earnings to expand their operations and, frequently, to repurchase their shares as well. Either course would,over time, substantially increase earnings-per-share. And \u2013 as has been the case since 1776 \u2013 whatever its problems ofthe minute, the American economy was going to move forward.Presented late in 2012 with the extraordinary valuation mismatch between bonds and equities, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 andI agreed to sell the bonds we had bought five years earlier and use the proceeds to buy 11,200 Berkshire \u201cB\u201d shares.The result: Girls Inc. of Omaha found itself receiving $2,222,279 last month rather than the $1 million it had originallyhoped for.Berkshire, it should be emphasized, has not performed brilliantly since the 2012 substitution. But brilliancewasn\u2019t needed: After all, Berkshire\u2019s gain only had to beat that annual .88% bond bogey \u2013 hardly a Herculeanachievement.The only risk in the bonds-to-Berkshire switch was that yearend 2017 would coincide with an exceptionallyweak stock market. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I felt this possibility (which alwaysexists) was very low. Two factors dictated this conclusion: The reasonable price of Berkshire in late 2012, and the large asset build-up that was almost certain to occurat Berkshire during the five years that remained before the bet would be settled. Even so, to eliminate allrisk to the charities from the switch, I agreed to make up any shortfall if sales of the 11,200 Berkshire shares at yearend 2017didn\u2019t produce at least $1 million. ************Investing is an activity in which consumption today is foregone in an attempt to allow greater consumptionat a later date. \u201cRisk\u201d is the possibility that this objective won\u2019t be attained.By that standard, purportedly \u201crisk-free\u201d long-term bonds in 2012 were a farriskier investment than a long- term investment in common stocks. At that time, even a 1% annual rate of inflation between 2012 and 2017 wouldhave decreased the purchasing-power of the government bond that Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I sold.I want to quickly acknowledge that inanyupcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier \u2013 far riskier \u2013 than short-term U.S. bonds. As an investor\u2019s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolioof U.S. equities becomes progressivelylessrisky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensiblemultiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons \u2013 among them, pension funds, collegeendowments and savings-minded individuals \u2013 to measure their investment \u201crisk\u201d by their portfolio\u2019s ratio of bondsto stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increaseits risk.************A final lesson from our bet: Stick with big, \u201ceasy\u201d decisions and eschew activity. During the ten-year bet,the 200-plus hedge-fund managers that were involved almost certainly made tens of thousands of buy and selldecisions. Most of those managers undoubtedly thought hard about their decisions, each of which they believed wouldprove advantageous. In the process of investing, they studied 10-Ks, interviewed managements, read trade journalsand conferred with Wall Street analysts.13Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I, meanwhile, leaning neither on research, insights nor brilliance, made only one investmentdecision during the ten years. We simply decided to sell our bond investment at a price of more than 100 times earnings(95.7 sale price/.88 yield), those being \u201cearnings\u201d that could not increase during the ensuing five years.We made the sale in order to move our money into a single security \u2013 Berkshire \u2013 that, in turn, owned adiversified group of solid businesses. Fueled by retained earnings, Berkshire\u2019s growth in value was unlikely to be lessthan 8% annually, even if we were to experience a so-so economy.After that kindergarten-like analysis, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I made the switch and relaxed, confident that, over time, 8%was certain to beat .88%. By a lot.The Annual MeetingThe annual meeting falls on May 5\nthand will again be webcast by Yahoo!, whose web address is https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream. The webcast will go live at 8:45 a.m. Central Daylight Time. Yahoo! willinterview directors, managers, stockholders and celebrities before the meeting and during the lunch break. Both theinterviews and meeting will be translated simultaneously into Mandarin.Our partnership with Yahoo! began in 2016 and shareholders have responded enthusiastically. Last year,real-time viewership increased 72% to about 3.1 million and replays of short segments totaled 17.1 million.For those attending the meeting in person, the doors at the CenturyLink will open at 7:00 a.m. on Saturdayto facilitate shopping prior to our shareholder movie, which begins at 8:30. The question-and-answer period will startat 9:15 and run until 3:30, with a one-hour lunch break at noon. Finally, at 3:45 we will begin the formal shareholdermeeting, which usually runs from 15 to 45 minutes. Shopping will end at 4:30.On Friday, May 4\nth, our Berkshire exhibitors at CenturyLink will be open from noon until 5 p.m. We addedthat extra shopping time in 2015, and serious shoppers love it. Last year about 12,000 people came through the doorsin the five hours we were open on Friday.Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in whichproducts from dozens of our subsidiaries will be for sale. (Your Chairman discourages freebies.) Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who will be captaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout thatsalutes all of our companies.Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our sixth annual \u201cBerkshire 5K,\u201d an 8 a.m. race starting at theCenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor\u2019s Guide that will be sent to you with yourmeeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire\u2019s managers,directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; even with Brooks running shoes, our times would beembarrassing.) Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help us set another record.A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company\u2019s top counselors fromaround the country. At last year\u2019s meeting, we set a record for policy sales, up 43% from 2016.So stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The discountis not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bring the details of yourexisting insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend the savings on other Berkshireproducts.Be sure to visit the Bookworm. This Omaha-based retailer will carry more than 40 books and DVDs, amongthem a couple of new titles. Berkshire shareholders are a bookseller\u2019s dream: When Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack(yes, ourCharlie) made its debut some years ago, we sold 3,500 copies at the meeting. The book weighed 4.85 pounds. Dothe math: Our shareholders left the building that day carrying about 8\n1\u20442tons of Charlie\u2019s wisdom.14An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain thecredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Keep in mind that most airlinessubstantially increase prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flyingto Kansas City vs. Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2\n1\u20442hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72\nndStreet between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having \u201cBerkshire Weekend\u201d discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must makeyour purchases between Tuesday, May 1\nstand Monday, May 7thinclusive, and must also present your meeting credential. Last year, the one-week volume for the store was a staggering $44.6 million. Bricks and mortar are aliveand well at NFM.The period\u2019s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers thatnormally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made anexception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During \u201cBerkshire Weekend,\u201d NFM will be open from 10 a.m. to9 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM ishosting a picnic to which you are all invited.NFM will again extend its shareholder\u2019s discount offerings to our Kansas City and Dallas stores. From May1\nstthrough May 7th, shareholders who present meeting credentials or other evidence of their Berkshire ownership (suchas brokerage statements) to those NFM stores will receive the same discounts enjoyed by those visiting the Omahastore.At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 4\nth. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. Remember, the more you buy, the more you save (or so my daughtertells me when we visit the store).We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30\nththrough Saturday, May 12th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showing youown our stock.On Sunday afternoon, on the upper level above Borsheims, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg,two of the world\u2019s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders. If they suggest wagering on the game,change the subject. Ajit, Charlie, Bill Gates and I will likely drop by as well.My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I metAriel when she was nine, and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Ariel represented the United Statesin the 2012 Olympics. If you don\u2019t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. BillGates did pretty well playing Ariel last year, so he may be ready to again challenge her. (My advice: Bet on Ariel.) Iwill participate on an advisory basis only.Gorat\u2019s will be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6\nth, serving from 12 p.m. until 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat\u2019s, call 402-551-3733 on April 2\nnd(but not before). Show you are a sophisticated diner by ordering the T-bone with hash browns.We will have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting, askingCharlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mailaddresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed atloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of theNew York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\n15From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interestingand important to shareholders. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if youkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than twoquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentionedif your question is asked.)An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year theinsurance specialist will be Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Questions that deal with our non-insuranceoperations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Sincewhat we will be conducting is ashareholders\u2019meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questionsthat add to our owners\u2019 understanding and knowledge of their investment.Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,for sure, and that\u2019s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren\u2019t allowed; we want to give as many questioners aspossible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire than when you came andfor you to have a good time while in Omaha.All told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for18 from the audience. After the 54\nth, all questions come from the audience. Charlie and I have often tackled more than60 by 3:30.The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m.on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room willhost, so to speak, a drawing.While I\u2019m on the subject of our owners\u2019 gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believeall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, shouldalso have adequate time to digest and analyze that information before any trading takes place. That\u2019s why we try toissue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday (aday that also eases traffic and parking problems).We do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts,treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder oflimited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings. As I run the company day-to-day \u2013 andas I write this letter \u2013 that is the shareholder whose image is in my mind. ************For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Starswho run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of ourmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most ofour managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business \u201chome runs\u201d means as much to them as theirpaycheck.If managers (or directors) own Berkshire shares \u2013 and many do \u2013 it\u2019s from open-market purchases theyhave made or because they received shares when they sold their businesses to us. None, however, gets the upside of ownership without risking the downside. Our directors and managers stand in your shoes.We continue to have a wonderful group at headquarters. This team efficiently deals with a multitude ofSEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 32,700-page Federal income tax return, oversees the filing of 3,935state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for thecountry\u2019s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\u2019s activities, fact-checks this letter \u2013 and the list goes on andon.\n16They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easyand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt withthe 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They alsohandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smotheredin Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. In addition, they cheerfully pitch in to help at the annual meeting in whateverway they are needed. They are proud to work for Berkshire, and I am proud of them. ************I\u2019ve saved the best for last. Early in 2018, Berkshire\u2019s board elected Ajit Jain and Greg Abel as directorsof Berkshire and also designated each as Vice Chairman. Ajit is now responsible for insurance operations, and Gregoversees the rest of our businesses. Charlie and I will focus on investments and capital allocation.You and I are lucky to have Ajit and Greg working for us. Each has been with Berkshire for decades, andBerkshire\u2019s blood flows through their veins. The character of each man matches his talents. And that says it all.Come to Omaha \u2013 the cradle of capitalism \u2013 on May 5\nthand meet the Berkshire Bunch. All of us look forward to your visit.February 24, 2018 Warren E. Buffett Chairman of the Board\n17"}
